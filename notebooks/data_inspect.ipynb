       "\"I can't say enough about how wonderful it was to stay here. It was the highlight of our stay in Nashville! Michele and her husband Collier felt like parents to my sister and I. They were so caring and helpful, giving us the best suggestions about places to eat and hang out in Nashville, and just being such warm, wonderful people that we had as much fun inside the house as we did going around Nashville! Also, the house was absolutely beautiful, and our room had a giant window looking out onto their backyard, which leads directly into a gorgeous park that we walked through every day. We felt so relaxed and happy there, it felt like home. We didn't want to leave!\""

       "'I can\\'t say enough about how wonderful it was to stay here. It was the highlight of our stay in Nashville! Michele and her husband Collier felt like parents to my sister and I. They were so caring and helpful, giving us the best suggestions about places to eat and hang out in Nashville, and just being such warm, wonderful people that we had as much fun inside the house as we did going around Nashville! Also, the house was absolutely beautiful, and our room had a giant window looking out onto their backyard, which leads directly into a gorgeous park that we walked through every day. We felt so relaxed and happy there, it felt like home. We didn\\'t want to leave! Michelle and Collier\\'s home is wonderful! They are both great people, Michele always nice and friendly on the phone and Collier was very sweet to tell us about the places to be in Nashville at night. With his advice my friend Raquel and I had a wonderful time in Nashville! Everyone we met in their home was very warm, including their housemate Sally, she was a lovely lady. I would definitely consider staying here again and would recommend anyone who is looking for a nice, comfortable place to stay and looking to meet very kind and genuinely good people to stay here. Thanks for everything =) Greetings from Miami!\\r\\n*Rachel I spent one night at Michele\\'s home and felt just wonderful and right at home. It\\'s a beautiful place, and Michele and her family are all extraordinarily welcoming, open-minded, warm and generous. Would use more and better words to describe them if my English was better... If you\\'re looking for a nice place to stay in Nashville and want to meet the nicest people, this is the place to be! Michele and Collier are two of the loveliest people it has been our pleasure to meet. The whole family (and that includes Sally) welcomed us into their home and we were treated like old friends. I could not recommend this beautiful place any more highly, if there were ten stars they would get all of them. The suggestions of where to go and what to see were so helpful to a couple of Aussies a long way from home, I wouldn\\'t think of staying anwhere else in Nashville. We made friends here and can\\'t wait to come back, thankyou for everything. We had the most lovely time staying with Michele and Collier. We had just moved to Nashville - house hunting, car hunting, exploring and getting ourselves settled- and we could not have felt more at home! The house is beautiful, the area is great to explore.... really enjoyed being right near the greenway, such a beautiful area! Michele and Collier are the most lovely of people. Could not recommend this lovely little home highly enough. My only complaint is that we couldn\\'t stay there longer!  My wife and I got back from a trip to Nashville and stayed at Michele and Collier\\'s place.  Great accomodations and a great host (Michele was out of town, so it was just Collier).  Very friendly and helpful with the lay of the land.  Could come and go as we pleased and it is very conveniently located next to Shelby park on the river front which made for a nice morning run.  Also very close to downtown Nashville.   Michelle and Collier\\'s home was safe and comfortable. We were welcomed and made to feel at home. The bed was comfortable and large. The room was private and had a great view. The pictures are very representative of the space. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis was our first experience with AirBnB, and all-in-all, my husband and I felt it was a good one. The price was very reasonable for the space, and the neighborhood was convenient to downtown (almost close enough to walk if you are in good shape). \\r\\n\\r\\nStaying in someone\\'s home is very different than staying in a hotel, but we had plenty of privacy, and all of the conveniences of being in a house. We would definitely stay with them again! We went from michelle and collier\\'s home to the gaylord \\'s resort. The contrast was almost too much.  I want to go back to michelle\\'s.  One is the real Nashville, the other is Disneyland. Staying with Michele and Collier made traveling to Nashville a joy. Michele immediately enveloped me in her warmth, opening spaces for conversation and attending to every traveler\\'s need. They were flexible and struck the right balance of allowing me privacy and being open and available. Their home beautifully reflects their adventurous spirit, with lovely colors and textures to explore everywhere. The room is large, comfortable, in terrific condition, and with everything I needed. The wooded setting provides lovely walking options. Highly recommended! No Words can really describe just how welcome I felt at Michele and Colliers.  Being a first time visitor to Nashville they were welcoming and had so much information about the surrounding areas and what to do.  I would recommend these guys to anyone wanting a comfortable stay for an incredible price....Will be back for sure! We stayed 3 nights at Michelle and Collier\\'s beautiful home.  They welcomed my wife and I and our 3 children with graciousness and a warm hospitality beyond any of our expectations. These are the kind of hosts with whom you feel right at home and coversation relaxes and rich. Our rooms were very comfortable, spotless and -like the rest of the house - colorful and well furnished. Collier\\'s breakfast biscuits were alone worth the trip from Maryland! Downtown Nashville is a short drive away, and their neighborhood quiet and pleasant, with many charming old houses. This was a wonderful experience and a true B&B experience in a big city neighborhood setting.  \\r\\nMark and Melanie  I stayed one night for a quick in and out trip.  I felt very welcome and comfortable as a single traveler.  The towels were great and the breakfast a nice treat.  The only thing no light at the bathroom mirror or good light to put on my makeup at night or under clouds. But hey I do it everyday so of course no clown left the house. If the opportunity arises again all the household members made me want to stay again at their great location. My husband and I instantly felt like part of the family when we arrived at Michele and Collier\\'s place.  It is a great space and they are welcoming and lovely hosts.  Their house is clean, the room we stayed in was large and comfy, and their pets were a highlight for me.  Michele gives great recommendations of places to go.  Breakfast was nice even though we had plans most mornings we were there to go out to meet friends.  We would love to stay here again when we return to Nashville.   Staying with Michele and Collier was the highlight of our trip to Tennessee! They went above and beyond to make their house feel like our home. It was clean, comfortable, quiet - we truly felt sad to leave! We really appreciated their many great suggestions of things to do / places to eat.\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat people, great pets, great house! Staying with Michele and Collier was so wonderful that we decided to stay with them again at the end of our trip. Their house really felt like our home. Coming back to Michele\\'s house for the second time felt like coming home. Everyone there including the pets really make you feel like part of the family. Beware, you might never want to leave them again! Staying with Collier and Michele was a true joy! They were so considerate and kind. Their home is absolutely beautiful and I absolutely loved staying there! I would recommend them to all my friends! When you stay with Michele and Collier, expect to never want to leave! Every morning was relaxing, and every evening when I returned, it felt like coming home. Michele and Collier are beautiful people, and so is the house!\\r\\nWhen staying here, be on the lookout for: extremely friendly cats, homemade bread, Collier-made recycled wine bottles-turned-glasses, enchantingly creaking floorboards, a listening ear(or 4), hidden light switches, an exciting amount of books, and intelligent conversation.\\r\\nAll of these things are contained in a single house, which I\\'m pretty sure is magical, because from the street it looks like a little two bedroom houselet, but actually goes on forever. \\r\\nThank you, Michele and Collier. See you again soon! Great house and great hosts.  Big beautiful, clean room with lots of natural daylight, facing a park.  Adorable cats and dog. Many good tips on what to do in Nashville (BTW you must see the Doyle and Debbie country music spoof). Delicious home made breakfast.  When we return to Nashville, we\\'ll stay here!! :)  Thanks Michele and Collier for making us feel at home. This was our second time staying at Michele and Collier\\'s place and overall- another great stay. Great location in East Nashville and is so close to downtown which was convenient for us  since we were there for an event.   Very homelike feel and they are very friendly.  Their pets are fun to have around too! We LOVED it! Michele and Collier provided us with a home away from home and we couldn\\'t have been more grateful. Their generosity and kindness was so wonderful, their house in a beautiful area close to everything you could need while not feeling like you\\'re stuck in the middle of the chaos of a city. Couldn\\'t have asked for anything better :) Nashville would have been a good experience no matter what accomodation I\\'d found, but staying with Michele, Collier, Ben and Sally in a big, lively, inviting atmosphere of home and happiness made it a truly wonderful experience. All these reviews confirm the quality and friendliness of the house and its\\' convenience for the city, so I have no hesitation in pointing out something that\\'s not so perfect...the dog and the piano both need tuning!\\r\\nThanks M & C for being so generous spirited and kind and for being such good and interesting ambassadors for Nashville! We were very happy staying with Michele and Collier.  Their home is lovely, they are lovely, and also full of good suggestions on things to do and see while visiting Nashville. Staying with Michelle & Collier is what Airbnb should be like everywhere; a shared experience of family, friends (& of course Nashville) with 2 of the loveliest people I\\'ve met on my travels.  I cannot recommend a stay more highly than this. If you\\'re heading down South but kinda wide of Nashville, make a detour! You won\\'t regret it. The location is brilliant - just a short drive from all that downtown offers which was more than I expected.  But what made this stay hit all the buttons was the open, generous and kind-hearted welcome I received and the interesting conversations we shared as political/ cultural sympaticos.  I didn\\'t want to leave but thank you both for everything. I\\'ll keep in touch.  Maggie x Michelle and Collier are such great hosts and made us feel very comfortable and welcome. Their house is located in a convenient location in Nashville, close to downtown and the freeway and they have a nice park right behind them. They make the best bread and coffee. We will definitely be back for another visit! They were kind and the scones were fabulous : )  We stayed for 4 nights in a visit to determine if Nashville would be our new home. We enjoyed the camaraderie, the great coffee, excellent breakfasts, clean room and bathroom, and we had enough privacy as well. Overall, it\\'s just the perfect spot to stay if you want to feel like you are visiting friends. I felt right at home with Michele and Collier. They helped me navigate Nashville as a first time visitor. Great location, great people, I\\'ll definitely be a regular! We could not recommend staying here more. We had an absolutely fabulous time here!! Everything about our experience was wonderful. We loved the house and the guys just filled it with such energy. We could have just moved in, we were sad to leave. Hopefully we\\'ll get to see Michele and Collier (or any member of the gang) on our soil as they are more than welcome, otherwise we\\'ll be back!!  This was our first time staying in a private home instead of a hotel.  We were a bit ill at ease when we arrived but that feeling soon melted away.  Michele, Collier and their family were wonderful, friendly hosts.  My 16 year old son and I enjoyed our stay and will likely stay with them again while in Nashville.  Their home was clean, a simple breakfast was available to us, and we fell in love with their little white dog and red cat.  Southern hospitality at it\\'s best! Truly enjoyed my stay, and was delighted by the home-made scones and delicious coffee in the morning!  I cannot recommend these folks enough! This was my second stay with Michelle and Collier. Once again everything was perfect.... happy people, good advice, adorable dog and cats, and yummy food. What more could I ask for? Jessa and I had a wonderful 3 days staying with Michele and Collier! They gave us a great orientation to Nashville and we had some wonderful conversations about activism, social justice, and life. They are incredibly welcoming and we would stay with them again in a heart beat. The house is large and charming, and the East Nashville area is equally charming. If you like walking there are some great restaurants and music venues within about 15 minutes walk. Michelle\\'s house was absolutely beautiful and she and her family were fantastic hosts. She kindly left us a delicious breakfast every morning and the room we stayed in was very clean, comfortable and cosy with two beds.\\r\\n\\r\\nTheir house is in a lovely neighbourhood a short bus ride away from the centre of town.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you so much Michelle for a wonderful stay - it was one of the real highlights of our trip. Michele and Collier extended us every courtesy during our stay and certainly went above and beyond their call of duty.  We enjoyed meeting their family and friends and felt immediately welcome in their home.  During our stay, we felt that we had the perfect balance of privacy and familial interaction and truly felt welcome in every regard.  They have a beautiful and unique home, which aptly reflects the personalities that inhabit the space.\\r\\n\\r\\nBonus points for their cat who thinks she is a dog and wags her tail as if she was one.   We couldn\\'t have asked for better hosts! Michele, Collier and the whole household were generous, warm and helpful. Had some great conversations over a delicious home cooked breakfast!\\r\\nThey went out of their way for us - not only did they drive us to the Greyhound Station at the end of our trip, but they even turned around and drove back when they realized that we left our packed lunch in their car.\\r\\nThe house was beautiful and the location was great. Wish we could have stayed for longer. We had a wonderful stay with Michele and her family during our visit to Nashville. Each detail -from fresh towels to fresh-baked scones and coffee in the morning- spoke of a comforting home away from home. Everyone was kind and accommodating -so much so, it made us sad to have to leave.   Anita and I just returned from our visit to Nashville.  We couldn\\'t have asked for better hosts!  Michele, Collier and the whole household were just great. They went out of their way to help us feel welcome and comfortable.  They gave us so many suggestions of places to visit it will take another longer trip to see them all, which we are currently talking about.  Of course this is where we will stay again, the house was beautiful and the location was fabulous.   Michele and her husband we so kind during our quick stay in Nashville. The room we stayed in was quiet and comfortable, perfect after our long road trip! Michele even provided a list of places to visit in New Orleans she received from another visitor, which we planned to visit the following week on our road trip (we ended up relying on a lot of those tips!). Next time, we\\'ll be sure to stay in Nashville longer. I was absolutely blown away by everything about my stay. I won\\'t repeat what everyone else has said, but I will agree wholeheartedly with every word. Michele, Collier, Ben and Rebecca were perfect hosts--there when you needed or wanted them, but never intrusive. I never felt a moment\\'s awkwardness--rather, a sense of genuine warmth and hospitality. Sunday brunch was to die for--everything made from scratch, organic and REAL food! I was in town for Wilco concerts at the Ryman, and when I mentioned to Michele that the weather was surprisingly chilly at night, she just loaned me her fleece pullover without a moment\\'s hesitation. That in itself might not be so remarkable, but it\\'s indicative of the friendly, unassuming, totally charming nature of the home and the happy and generous people who live there. This was not only a lovely place to stay, in an amazing neighborhood, but it was also soul nourishing.  Made to feel very welcome in spite of arriving during a family crisis, we hope Collier is making a good recovery. it wasJust like staying with friends.Nice accommodation with easy access to downtown Nashville. Had a great time, thanks to you all. They were my first and best host I have had! They made breakfast every morning or at least made sure we had something to eat or drink. Very loving and warming home. They knew all the hot spots of Nashville! I will recommend this host to anyone wanting to visit Nashville. It was a great location, not to far away and not to close.  Michele and Collier were a joy to be around! They truly felt like family. It was a quick trip for us, but we felt right at home. Their home is very cozy and clean. We had everything that we needed. Michele and Collier were also very helpful when it came to giving us information about the city and things to do. And, Michele makes an amazing breakfast! We recommend Michele and Collier\\'s home to anyone! If we are in the Nashville area again in the future, we will definitely being staying with them again!  My friend and I came to Nashville for a busy three nights of country music events and visiting friends and family. Michele and Collier were perfect hosts. They were two of the nicest, most welcoming people I\\'ve met. They had a room set up for us, and always made sure we had something to eat in the morning for breakfast. The house was at a great location which was awesome for going around town. Our only regret was not being able to spend more time with them. I will defiently stay here again when I come to Nashville. I enjoyed it much more than a hotel stay :) Thanks Michele and Collier!  My husband and I went to Nashville this past weekend to meet our good friends\\' new baby! We would normally stay with them but because it is such a delicate time in their home we wanted to stay overnight somewhere else. Michele and Collier live 3 blocks from our friends! The location couldn\\'t have been better. Michele and Collier were very accommodating to what our wishes were. We arrived later (around 9pm) and just wanted to bathe and sleep (tired from our drive up) and to get up and go. A quicky, if you will. I slept like a rock in their guest room, in fact, I slept in until 9! Which is so unlike me. I think this was because we felt so comfortable in their home. We will definitely request to stay again when visiting Nashville and will tell all of our friends about Michele and Collier\\'s colorful cozy home.  We were checking out Nashville as a potential living location, and Michele was an incredible hostess.  She and her husband Collier were very warm, hospitable, and accommodating.  They gave us wonderful information about neighborhoods in Nashville and where to go.  The area they live in--East Nashville--is also a great neighborhood with nearby independent coffee shops and restaurants.  Plus, it\\'s all very safe and easy access to all of Nashville, including downtown.  Highly recommend! We had a wonderful experience staying in Michele and Collier\\'s home. Michele and her family (including the dog and two cats!) were very welcoming, and did everything they could to make us feel at home. The next time we are in Nashville, we will definitely look her up. The host canceled my reservation 8 days before arrival. Thank you so much Michelle and Collier! We had such a pleasant stay and loved the hospitality.  This was my 1st experience staying with an airbnb and I would have to say, I picked one of the BEST people to stay with. Michelle and her family made me feel like I was a part of theirs. It felt like I\\'ve known them forever. They gave us the low down on the ins and outs of the city. Next time I visit Nashville, I\\'ll be back to see them.  From the moment I arrived, I felt welcome and at home, but also enjoyed a sense of total privacy.   There were fresh flowers from the garden and coffee better than Starbucks!  In fact, would never consider another option when I\\'m in Nashville.   Plus the house was lovely and I enjoyed being in an amazingly cool neighborhood within a short drive to downtown (Website hidden by Airbnb) Michelle and her family were so welcoming, we felt like part of the family. Would highly recommend staying at Nashville Charm to anyone. Had a great time with Michelle, and family and friends. I arrived at dinner time and was invited to have a yummy home-cooked meal. Great house, nice people, good time. Thanks! \\r\\nContacting Michelle the day before arrival was a little slow; Did have to try a few methods of contacting her before I heard back from her (the late morning/afternoon of arrival)..but being new to air BnB, it could be that I just wasn\\'t using the right method. I tried her email, then her personal phone, \\r\\nthen air BnB text..that worked best and I heard from her pretty soon after air bnb text. Michele and Collier were fantastic hosts!  This was our first airbnb experience and we had a good time.  They provided great suggestions for exploring Nashville and made us a delicious breakfast. Couldn\\'t have asked for a better place to stay while in Nashville. The house was beautiful and our room was spacious. The Flynns made us feel very welcome and were extremely helpful in telling us about all things Nashville. Also, they have adorable pets! For the first time using airbnb I feel like we were very lucky. I highly recommend them for your stay in Nashville.  The first thing I had to do when I stepped inside this room was take a moment to adjust to all the space I had! There was a work desk, a couch, and of course a large bed all spread out in the large room. Collier and Michele were both very hospitable, friendly hosts and I enjoyed talking and getting to know them both. The location of this home is also a steal because of it\\'s close proximity to the downtown area. I highly recommend that you reserve this room on your next stay in Nashville.  Michele and her husband are wonderful hosts. I really felt at home when I arrived at their place.The large TV in the bedroom was perfect to watch the opening ceremony of the Olympic games. Their breakfast was delicious. Her homemade scones with honey and fresh figs from her tree with a large cup of coffee made me start the day strong and wide awake for my road trip. I enjoyed chatting with them and would make sure to stop at their place again when I plan another trip in Nashville.  We really enjoyed staying with Michele and her family. The room is very spacious and comfortable. We had a very restful experience. The breakfast provided was delicious! We also had a fantastic brunch with her family and friends. Michele is a great host and we would highly recommend her.  What a story!! It was just fantastic... \\r\\nIt\\'s maybe the first time that behind the \"pay-to-stay\" logic we felt a true sense of sharing, a true sense of sharing humanity. And that\\'s not French rhetoric it\\'s real. The breakfasts were tastefully perfect and reflected the reason why we do love this place and its people. Michele, Collier and Rebecca are genererous, smart, helpful and funny people. They are both interested and interesting persons. \\r\\nIt\\'s easily understandable, it is THE place to stay in when being in Nashville!!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH What a great place to stay! I\\'m from Nashville and I have to say this was such a better choice than booking a hotel, which I normally do when visiting. The location is great, just minutes from all of East Nashville\\'s best. Michele was so welcoming and made us feel right at home. The space is very peaceful and serene, and the view of the park was wonderful. I would definitely stay here again!   Michele and Collier were great hosts, and the space was wonderful.  The room was spacious with a comfortable bed and nice desk, windows overlooking the park.  The location is ideal for East Nashville, and I would have loved to spend more time there.  I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Nashville. Great hosts, great value, great location. Perfect :) :) I totally recommend this place. BIG room, cozy animals. Very hospitable and friendly people :) Nice, clean, big room. Very, very hospitable guest. We felt so welcome like we are old family friends. We had a parking spot right outside and its only a 5 min drive to downtown Nahsville. Great Folks! We felt welcome and enjoyed every minute of our time with this boisterous family. Would highly recommend. These guys are just the best :) And for that price? Top-Notch . We enjoyed a lovely stay with Michele in her beautiful Nashville home. Our GPS guided us to the door and Michele met us, she was warm and friendly and instantly made us feel at home. The room is very large and clean with a great view of the park, and we effectively had a bathroom to ourselves. Michele went out of her way to be helpful to us and advise us on places to see (definitely eat at Mas Tacos if you have a chance), she even gave us a ride into town and made us a delicious breakfast. Our only regret is that we couldn\\'t stay longer and get to know her better. We hope to return to Nashville someday and would definitely stay with Michele again.  I loved staying at Michelle\\'s! I had a nice big room with a sofa and TV. The location was also great! Michelle was an excellent host. She was very friendly and gave me some great suggestions on places to go around town. I had a great experience! My room was very spacious with its own sofa and a beautiful window that viewed a park. Michele and Collier were great hosts and made my stay very comfortable! I would recommend this place to anyone! The kindest people in a great neighborhood! Michele and Collier were awesome hosts. They were very inviting and helpful. Everyday Michele told us where the best places were to hang out and meet the most interesting people in Nashville - most of the time it was right in their own home. The house is very communal, the conversations and interesting and fun! They were also very understanding when I had a family emergency pop up that cut our trip short. \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Michele and Collier!  I feel lucky I got to stay here. A smart, gracious, wise, and laughter filled household.   The room is spacious, lovely, and has a comfortable bed.  The bathroom is perfect.  All the house is really extraordinary with love written all over it.  These are really good folks.  Great neighborhood in the heart of east Nashville.  Thank you Michele and family for having me and sharing all your kindnesses. Michele is one of the nicest people I have met, not just on Airbnb, but in Nashville! I don\\'t usually leave long reviews, but their home was so so great! Her husband Collier was really nice too! They made me feel so at home and the spread that they put on for breakfast in the morning was AMAZING!! The room was super spacious and the value for money was superb! I wont be staying anywhere else in Nashville when i come back next year!  What a wonderful Tennessee trip! It was a little rainy on my two extra days in town, but I did my best to take advantage of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nMichele Flynn is the sweetest host and goes above and beyond to make your stay feel warm and welcomed. Fresh towels, access to do laundry, spacious bedroom with internet availability, and a natural view out of the room\\'s window (no houses).\\r\\n\\r\\nI had a chance to explore quite a bit of the area including 5-Points (local hangout), downtown Nashville, nearby parks and rivers.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust behind the property within walking distance is an incredible park & golf course. I was especially pleased with seeing the amazing train trestle and took full advantage of the running trail that begins below it. A great area to breathe in the fresh air and view the river and ponds.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe residence is located in the perfect place for nearby shops and bus transportation. The home is very cozy and warm with friendly pets and beautiful book collection upstairs.\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone was very respectful of noise. \\r\\n\\r\\nI will certainly be going back in the future to stay with Michele again. Such great people and a wonderful neighborhood. we had a great time in Nashville. Really enjoyed the neighborhood that Michell\\'s house was in , nice biking path. Very easy to get to and  from the  downtown also. Collier and Michelle were great hosts, we enjoyed our conversation with them and laughted alot at the stories. My husband love the hammock on the porch. The breakfast was very good. loved the scones. The room was bright and airy. We would stay here again if we return to the area. We loved the little town of Centerville that we went to. Staying with Michelle & her husband, Collier, was wonderful!  They were very welcoming & offered to pick  us up at our bus stop.  My daughter & I felt right at home-especially having pets close by. We felt like we were with extended family & were treated as such.  They are awesome hosts! We spent a Friday night at this lovely home. Michele had been called out of town suddenly, but her husband was a wonderful host. We had some great conversation and a super night\\'s sleep. The view from the bedroom is wonderful, and the cat Serendipity was very welcoming. We are now trying to figure out a reason to come back to Nashville so we can have an excuse to spend another night at this home! \\r\\nAlso, there are lots of cool eating places nearby in five points.  Wasn\\'t able to make it but Michelle was very easy to communicate with and very helpful! Next time im south I will be checking her out! Perfect! Michele was very nice and helpful. Will definitely stay there again next time I\\'m town! Talk about Southern hospitality... Everything about my stay with Michele and Collier was marvellous, from the pick-ups and drop-offs to the adorable pets and the homemade biscuits for breakfast. The room is spacious and comfortable, the house is well-located (next to a bus stop or about an hour\\'s walk from downtown), and I felt at home from the moment I arrived. Michele and Collier are generous, big-hearted people and good company - will definitely stay there again next time I\\'m in town. Everything was fantastic at Collier and Michele\\'s lovely home! The art of hospitality is not lost on these two, and I\\'ve never been in the home of a stranger and felt more like family! Their home is eclectic and lovely and all the members of the house are simply a delight to be around. The homemade breakfast scones and all the delicious foods on the brunch menu were fantastic, and the conversation made it difficult to leave! I can honestly say that every time I visit Nashville, I will return to their house for my stay. Thank you all so very much for such a memorable experience!  Just stayed for one night to go to a concert, but wish that we could have stayed longer!  Their house is so cute and Michele and her husband are extremely nice! Their animals are also very sweet.  I spent a few hours cuddling with their cat Jelico. In the morning Michele made us fresh biscuits that tasted delicious!! If we ever go to Nashville again, I will definitely stay here! Michele was a wonderful host.  Very welcoming.  She took the time to give me some recommendations for exploring the city, and baked marvelous pumpkin muffins for breakfast.  The room itself is bright and spacious, and the bed is comfortable.  Peaceful, but very convenient to Nashville.  I had a wonderful time! This was my second time staying at this wonderful Nashville Airbnb.  As they say the \"second time is a charm\" and as happened with my virst stay earlier this year, this time around was absolutely comfortable and I now consider staying with hosts, Michelle and Collier, who are warm and accommodating, a requirement to for my visits to Nashville.  The house is immaculate and the neighborhood is really great and walkable to nearby places; and within a few minutes to downtown Nashville and all major expressways.    Michele was extremely welcoming. The room was comfortable and spacious. I wish I could have staying longer. It was a great place to stay.  Michele and her husband Collier were very welcoming hosts for my one week stay.  My room was very comfortable.  I awoke every morning with fresh fruit and all the fixings laid out for me on the kitchen counter along with a new note from Michele wishing me a productive day.  At the end of my stay on Sunday, they invited me to join them and their friends for a brunch in the dining room.  I came and went as I wished, and they made me feel quite comfortable for my first time using airbnb.  They come highly recommended.   Our stay with Michele and Collier was a highlight of our time in Nashville. Our hosts were kind and welcoming (everything from the perfect room to the delicious coffee and breakfasts) and gave us helpful tips on how best to navigate the city. By the time we left, it felt like we were saying goodbye to old friends.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe can\\'t wait to visit Nashville again, and will hopefully make \"Nashville Charm\" our home base again! Michele and her family welcomed us with open arms and a hug, which was a nice thing after a 9 hour drive. She had a map for us, regarding the places we wanted to go and things we wanted to do. Even though we only spent one night in her house it was a fabulous experience. Her home is beautiful. I appreciate the breakfast that she left us in the morning and the key they let us use to let ourselves in and out.  Thinking about moving to Nashville, I needed a place to do recon from. Michele and her whole family were extremely accommodating to my plans, helpful, friendly and full of good advice. The house was comfortable and very convenient. We may stay there again! We couldn\\'t have asked for, or imagined, better hosts than Michele and her husband! The accommodations were inviting, warm, and more than comfortable, despite the stormy weather outside. Such generous hosts! Our stay was the perfect introduction to the Nashville community. We will certainly be back! Or sending friends :) Comfortable and excellent stay for our first visit to Nashville (and first Airbnb stay)! Michele and Collier were so welcoming and nice. We could not have asked for a better host family! Our room was very spacious, bed was great, bathroom was clean, and towels were out for us. We loved how close the house was to downtown. We recommend Michele\\'s home to anyone. They make you feel right at home!  Michele & Collier are the perfect hosts, and it\\'s a true pleasure to stay with them in their home. They\\'re so welcoming and friendly and made sure i felt like part of the family, straight away. The pets are gorgeous too, especially Serendipity the cat. This is definitely my #1 pick whenever i visit Nashville Michelle and her husband Collier were delightful hosts.  We felt at home the minute we entered their home, which was in a quiet residential area of lovingly restored homes.  Their home bordered a park and the bedroom wall was lined with windows looking out onto the park.  Very nice!  The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was immaculate.  My stay included a Sunday and Michelle prepared a delicious brunch which included eggs, homemade biscuits, fresh fruits and vegetables.  Michelle and Collier were both very attentive hosts and were always concerned that we were enjoying our stay.  Their location was easily accessible(by car) to The District and other Nashville attractions.  My friend and I really enjoyed our stay at Nashville Charm!   What a perfect stay! Michelle & her husband Collier are genuinely lovely people, and such wonderful hosts. We really liked their house, the spacious, comfortable room, the neighbourhood and Nashville, and would recommend coming here. They were both attentive and helpful, answering our questions and engaging in conversation, even inviting us to Sunday morning brunch with them, which we will always remember Michele was a wonderful host.  The house was comfortable and the perfect place to stay in a very nice and interesting part of the city. She gave us great advice about where to go in the city and was warm and kind from the moment we met her. We loved our stay with her and would recommend it to anyone going to Nashville. \\r\\nThanks very much!!\\r\\n-Anna & April (Roadtrippin\\' gals from Montreal, Canada) Michele is a warm,personable,genuine and spiritual woman who is most welcoming and helpful.Her generosity of spirit adds to her light.Her spouse,Collier,is a very engaging,interesting,intelligent and lucky man,\\r\\nwhose love for the law is evident.Their house is the most homelike\\r\\nairbnb place to date.A willingness to go the extra mile to make one feel welcome is heartwarming.\\r\\nIf you can\\'t feel comfortable here,forget it.\\r\\nMichele\\'s sweet tart offering in the AM with a note gave my stay that special something extra.Her gift of homemade corn bread for the road was to die for.\\r\\nMy only regret is that I hadn\\'t planned to stay longer.\\r\\nTheir home is a definite keeper.Thanks ever so much. Great place, great location and great price!  This was my first airbnb stay, and Michelle was more than hospitable, and very helpful if you\\'re looking for Nashville advice.  (They told me to eat dinner at Mas Tacos, and those were some of the best tacos I\\'ve ever had).  \\r\\nTheir description says you don\\'t have a private bathroom, and while that is technically true, it\\'s all pretty darn private upstairs, it\\'s almost like a suite.  The bed can be a little hard on the hips, but this is a great value with very nice people.   Such a great experience staying here. Michele and her husband made us feel very at home-we didn\\'t want to leave! We also loved that we could easily walk downtown in 45 minutes. Thank you again!!! Michele\\'s brother is ill so she was not there while I stayed in the house, but her husband Collier greeted me, gave me a key and towels and set up my breakfast for me. The house is beautiful and in a cute little neighbor-- it was so easy to get around Nashville from their place! The room was clean and comfortable, the internet worked great and the bathroom was great too. This was my first Air B n B experience and I couldn\\'t have asked for a better one! This is by far our best airbnb experience yet! Our room was LARGE and with big windows overlooking a nearby park. But that is not the best thing. The hosts Michele and Collier are the sweetest people one could ask for. Michele took care of everything before we got there, but had to leave before our stay, so we spend a lot of good times in the kitchen with Collier, who tells the greatest stories and is simply wonderful to be around and helpful to an extent which is more than you would ever ask for. In short, book with these guys, we promise you will never regret it! We had a wonderful stay at Michele\\'s house.  When we arrived she was heading through town so was kind enough to give us a lift to hers and show us some places to go in East Nashville on the way. \\nThe room is really spacious, it has a laundry room attached to it and the internet\\'s very fast.  I\\'d agree with an earlier review that the bathroom feels very private too - it\\'s right next to the room and is rarely used by anyone else. \\nThe location is good - easy walking distance to a cluster of lovely bars and restaurants in East Nashville and walking to downtown took about 50mins. There\\'s also a bus which goes from almost right outside the house and takes about 10 mins to get to downtown.\\nBreakfast was lovely everyday - homemade biscuits and scones. \\nIt really was such a great place to stay, and incredible value - the house is gorgeous, we felt really welcome and it\\'s a great location. If we\\'re ever back in Nashville we\\'d definitely want to stay again.  This was my second stay with Michele and Collier, and just as last time, they were incredibly hospitable. Very welcoming to new guests, and gave my friends tons of information about jobs and moving to the area. They made us feel as if we were part of the family, and very accommodating. Thanks for such a great stay!! Michele & Collier could not have been more wonderful hosts! From the moment I walked in the door, they made me feel like family. They have a beautiful old house, and the room I stayed in looks out onto a park. The accommodations are more than adequate and match the description in the listing very well, but it\\'s really the spirit with which guests are welcomed that sets this Airbnb apart. When I arrived, the Flynns were more than happy to take time out of their day and engage me in great conversation, sharing stories about their family and Nashville history. They had superb recommendations for what to check out in the area (East Nashville, by the way, is highly recommended - a quiet neighborhood with a vibrant nightlife and beautiful architecture, and reasonably easy to get to from downtown via public transit). I was lucky enough to stay on a Sunday morning and enjoyed a delicious family-style brunch. As a first-time Airbnb user, I was apprehensive about what the experience would be like. Before my arrival, the Flynns were great about being flexible around my travel arrangements and responded quickly to all my communications. I couldn\\'t imagine a better introduction to the service - this amazing couple clearly doesn\\'t offer their home just to use their extra space, but they see it as a form of service and a way to extend, in their words, \"radical hospitality\" to whoever is lucky enough to stay with them. Couldn\\'t recommend them enough! Michele\\'s inviting and beautiful house is a home away from home. Nestled in and among our new favorite hang outs and neighborhoods, this is a treasure for people seeking out all sorts of adventure and experiences. We had to tear ourselves away from their adorable pets as we loved our mornings with them. Michele is such a gracious host and made us feel incredibly welcomed. Nashville quickly ranked among our favorite cities with the friendliest folks around, delicious food, and amazing local haunts within walking/biking distance. Between the gorgeous home and the perfect location, the wonderful hospitality, the delicious breakfasts Michele created for us, the loving pets, the great conversations (the list could go on and on...) -  we can\\'t wait to come back and visit Michele again. FIVE STARS!!! My stay at Michele and Collier\\'s home was fantastic: the room was comfortable and clean, their home is in a very convenient location, and the host warm and friendly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you for your kindness! We only had a quick stay here, but Michele was generous, helpful, and hospitable. The place was immaculate and comfy, close to town, and totally worth the price. We were in Nashville for one night before we continued on our trip. We arrived a little late in the evening but found a nice selection of restaurants five minutes away from their house. When we arrived it was a very warm and welcome greeting. The house was beautiful, clean, and wonderfully decorated. Michele her self was an extremely kind and caring person. She made sure we had everything we needed, helped us settle in, and showed us where everything was before we unpacked. We had to be up early the following morning and had the car loaded by the time they woke up. The quickly made us some coffee and put them in travel cups to take on the road along with fruit and muffins. It was such a comfortable stay and we would be more than excited to go back and spend more time. We both said it.. Michele and her husband are top notch! They kind of spoiled it for all of the other airbnb hosts. :)  Their house was beautiful and comfortable. The space was private. They were both very welcoming. Our stay in Nashville was incredible. Highly, Highly, Highly recommend! These two are amazing people!  Michelle and her family were wonderful hosts. We had such a good time in Nashville and they pointed us into direction of some of their favorite places in Nashville. Michele and her family were such wonderful hosts! From the second we arrived, they were so cheerful and helpful, giving us recommendations for food and nearby locals spots. We only had a short stay with them so we didn\\'t get to visit much, but the accommodations were fantastic - very clean, and I believe we were the only ones using the bathroom. She even left us breakfast the next morning since we were leaving later than her. Would, and probably will, stay with them again next time we\\'re in Nashville! Their pets were lovely, and we thoroughly enjoyed our time with them! Catching a red-eye from LAX, to attend a 40 year reunion, I knew I would need a \"special Airbnb\" spot to \\'regroup and chill out.\\'  Nashville Charm = Island of Tranquility.  (My hypothesis of adjacent green-way park being directly proportional to a lowering of noise and traffic proved correct.)  Lucky for me, the Famous Sunday Brunch occurred my first morning there:  interesting conversation with beautiful and exotic guests and family, delicious crepes--and fillings--which are making my mouth water as I write this, and just the feeling that these people are as friendly, nice, and welcoming as the other friends I had known for 40 years.  Even though I didn\\'t search out close-by places to eat or shops to peruse, I could see there were numerous such places to visit had I desired.  (East  Nashville = the New, Happening, Vibrant part of town.)  I got along great with the 2 cats and Scout, the dog (Hint:  lightly scratch behind ears.....)\\r\\n    I\\'m not sure whether Collier and Michelle did some really special things to make my 3 day trip to Nashville wonderful, or if that\\'s how \\'they always do it.\\'  I guess I\\'ll have to drop by again sometime, to find out.  (Thanks!)\\r\\n I had a great visit at Nashville Charm with Michele!  I plan to stay there again when I am back in Nashville.   Staying with Michele and her family was such a great experience! They were incredibly gracious and welcoming and it felt like staying with close family friends. I highly recommend booking with them for warmth and hospitality when you are away from home. This was my first experience as an airbnb-er, so I was a little bit anxious about staying, and didn\\'t really know what to expect. As soon as I met Michele, all my worries went out the window! Michele and Collier were such genuine and warm hosts, who went out the their way to make sure my stay was comfortable and enjoyable. Their home was absolutely beautiful and the room I stayed in was huge, clean and had everything I needed. The upstairs room over looked beautiful Shelby Park, and their house located really close to a bus stop that takes you downtown.\\r\\nMichele made an awesome brunch one morning, which was super yummy complete with the best chocolate chip muffins I have ever had!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nAll in all this was such a positive experience, and next time I\\'m in Nashville- I know where I will be staying!!! We had a great stay with Michelle and Collier!  They were extremely welcoming and offered great recommendations on places to go in Nashville.  The room was large and very comfortable and we were within walking distance of many shops and restaurants.  We would love to revisit Nashville and stay here again! Michele was a very accommodating and helpful host. The house is lovely and the bedroom is very large and comfortable. I would recommend staying here! Michele was a lovely host. This was the first time I have ever rented a room in a house (instead of an entire apartment) on airbnb, and I felt all the security of being in a home (I was travelling alone), combined with the peace and quite of having my own private space. I drove up from Memphis to catch an early morning flight the next day out of Nashville airport, and Michele was very flexible about my late arrival and very early departure. It is an easy 15 minute drive to the airport. Plus! The house is in a great neighborhood with easy access to a park, restaurants, and Jeni\\'s ice cream :) Michele\\'s home is very charming and beautifully decorated, I promise you will feel at ease in her house! Michele and her family are very good and warm hosts. It\\'s a very pleasant house in a quiet and green neighborhood. From the room\\'s windows we had a pretty view of the park behind the house with fireflies in the evening. There\\'s a bus-stop in front of the house and the bus needs only 12 minutes to downtown.  We got a very good breakfast and had a really good time in Nashville. We would recommend staying there.\\r\\n\\r\\nMichele und ihre Familie waren sehr freundliche und warmherzige Gastgeber. Ihr wunderschönes Haus liegt in einem sehr ruhigen und grünen Viertel. Das Zimmer hat Aussicht auf den Park hinter dem Haus, wo man abends Glühwürmchen sehen kann. Direkt neben dem Haus gibt es eine Bushaltestelle, der Bus nach downtown braucht nur 12 Minuten. Das Frühstück war sehr gut. Wir hatten eine wirklich schöne Zeit in Nashville.\\r\\nMichele können wir als Gastgeber nur wärmstens empfehlen! The reservation was canceled 39 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. Michele and her husband are really sweet people, who made us almost feel like home. They gave good advice about where to go, see and park in the city.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is definately a place we would recommend others to go to! Michele is an AWESOME host! =) Michele, along with her husband and daughter, are very sweet and inviting. They let you feel like a part of the family. I\\'m so glad I was able to stay at Nashville Charm. The next time I visit, I\\'m DEFINITELY booking with Michele again! This house is so unique in decor and style. There\\'s something to catch your eye in every room! Michele was incredibly welcoming and a great host. For breakfast she had fresh fruits, juice, pour over coffee and home made chocolate chip banana muffins.  I also loved that it was right next to Shelby park which is a nice place to run or take a walk. Would definitely stay here again. This was my first Airbnb experience and it definitely won\\'t be my last! Michele was such a wonderful host. She was very flexible with our late arrival and very accommodating in every possible way. She provided delicious homemade scones for us in the morning and we had lovely conversation over coffee. Her home was beautiful and comfortable. If Nashville is your destination I would definitely recommend staying with Michele! Our stay with Michele was wonderful. The most generous and kind host I have yet experienced through Airbnb. The lodging was all it was expected to be. Michelle and her husband were great hosts! I wasn\\'t in Nashville long, but they went above and beyond to make me feel very welcome. I would recommend anyone staying here for their time in Nashville.  I had the best time and absolute loved my stay. Welcoming and loving. I hope to come back again soon!  My husband & myself stayed Michele & Colliers Nashville Charm, it was fabulous. The room was lovely and clean & decorated tastefully, their home was very convenient to all the sights and adventures around Nashville. Both went out of their way, to help us with suggestions and advice, even directions of the best way to get around  town.   But it was Michele\\'s warmth and kind hospitality that made our visit extra special! Coming from Australia, we will be back, someday and hope to stay there again!  Michele and Collier choose to make the world a better place--one act of kindness at a time. Well, actually, many acts of kindness all at once. If you stay in their home, I think you\\'ll choose to be as good a guest as you possibly can. You\\'ll love \"Nashville Charm\" so much, you\\'ll be extra-inspired for trying to do your own good.  De part leurs gentillesses et leurs conseils Michele,Collier et leur fille ont fait de mon séjour à Nashville un petit Paradis. La maison est situé dans un quartier très cool et branché et est à 10 min du centre en Bus. J\\'ai passé 2 semaines extraordinaires. De plus Michele fait les meilleurs muffin et Collier le meilleur pain !!  My sister and I had a lovely stay in Michelle\\'s cozy home. Michelle and Collier were super friendly and inviting and gave us great recommendations on where to eat and what to do. The location is great, with lots of street parking, and super close to downtown Nashville. We would definitely stay here again!  Michele and family were the best. This was our first airbnb and first time to Nashville and we felt at home right away. I can\\'t suggest her enough. She is really experienced in airbnb and everything went smooth as can be. Felt like we were staying with relatives or something like that. The room was great, it is a futon bed, but my girlfriend and myself fit plenty comfortably on it. It was actually really comfortable. A+ all around.  I\\'ll miss the neighbourhood, but utmost I\\'ll remember the beautiful southern-style porch in the falling of autumn leaves. Michele and her family were very hospitable and always super friendly, as well as the room being comfortable and peaceful - really felt like a home away from home! I even left a phone behind and they couldn\\'t have been happier to send it on to me. Bring on my return ASAP! Michele was so warm and welcoming! She has a very beautiful house and a lovely family. I enjoyed my stay there and would definitely recommend her home for anyone looking for a place to stay in Nashville! Thanks for such a wonderful stay, Michele and Collier! We enjoyed our visit with you. You made us feel so welcome in your home and it was very convenient to also check out downtown from your location in East Nashville. Thanks again for everything! Best to you both :) I had an awesome stay with Michele and Collier.  I was grateful for the super friendly hosts, great morning coffee, comfy bed and a location next to hip places in Nashville.  I would highly recommend a stay on Fatherland St!  For the price, it could not be beat.  Michele and her husband are great hosts! I was very comfortable during my stay. Would definitely recommend! A GREAT place to stay with very caring, friendly and helpful hosts!  Michele took us at a time when she ordinarily does not take many people (holiday time), and we thoroughly enjoyed our whirlwind trip.  Wish we could have stayed longer to visit, but we\\'ll be back if we can.  Don\\'t even hesitate to stay at Nashville Charm; you\\'ll love it!  Thanks Michele and Collier! Michele was wonderful & the house was perfect for us! Thank you for everything! Michelle\\'s hospitality and generosity extended well beyond what one would expect from an airbnb host. I felt more as if I was a family friend who had come to stay. Staying with her and her lovely husband in their well appointed, well located,(in cool, close to downtown area with bus stop on doorstep), family home was warm and most comfortable as they went out of their way to make sure I had all I needed. They were also extremely helpful in my getting around Nashville and their knowledge of it. They are very special people and if going to Nashville I would highly recommend staying with them. Just as everyone else has said, Michelle and Collier are wonderful. Nashville is a fantastic city and they personify the friendliness, warmth, tolerance and open mindedness we encountered throughout our stay. I couldn\\'t recommend this highly enough! Michelle and Collier were awesome hosts. This was our first experience with Airbnb and we chose perfect host I think. Being that we are from Australia any tips on where to shop and see live music was well received. So very helpful and friendly. Their place was warm and inviting, their fur babies were also very friendly. Their place was very close to downtown if your up for a party night. \\r\\nWe chose to use Airbnb as we didn\\'t want high costs for accom as we intended on being out most of the time. This place was great very affordable, comfortable bed and full use of laundry saved us finding coin laundries to do our washing.\\r\\nMichelle and Collier were out of town on our arrival (unexpected family visit) but didn\\'t cancel on us as we were unreachable for the first week of our vacation. Instead Michelle had a former boarder come and greet us upon our arrival. Michael was also very friendly and welcoming. Definitely consider staying here when next in town.\\r\\n\\r\\nNext time we visit Nashville we will certainly look Michelle up again We loved this house! Michele and Collier were great hosts and fun to talk to. We\\'ll definitely stay with them on our next trip to Nashville  This home is warm and welcoming. It has some adorable pets abound as well. I was really tired during my travels and this stay was just right for relaxing.  Great location.  So great! Michele was the ideal hostess and their house is so lovely and cozy. We had a perfect stay. They offered us great advice about what to do and where to eat. Their house is well located within walking distance to some restaurants and bars and a quick drive into downtown. What a wonderful couple and a wonderful place!  Also, I couldn\\'t believe she made us scones.  Michele agreed to host us at the last minute and welcomed us into her beautiful home.  Filled with color and fun art.  She made us brownies for our dessert and left us a lovely breakfast in her sunny kitchen.   I can\\'t gush enough about how much I enjoyed staying at the NASHVILLE CHARM. Everything about my stay was perfect! I just wish that I had been able to stay longer... Hopefully will return one day! Michele and Collier were wonderfully warm and hospitable, I so loved spending time with them and was sorry to stay only a short time.  Their home is gorgeous and I slept like a log.  If I ever get back to Nashville, I swear I\\'ll be round theirs again!  Thanks so much both, love from London! i had a great experience here! michele and collier were very warm and inviting, and left me breakfast every morning. i even got some kitty snuggles in my room. the neighborhood is awesome too. thanks for the wonderful place to stay! Really brilliant stay. Great location, and wonderful hospitality. Highly recommend!  We had a great stay in this lovely room! This beautiful home really radiates with a warm, safe, and welcoming energy. We had everything we needed for a great stay in Nashville. We would definitely stay again.  Michele is a lovely lady with a warm heart! She really makes you feel welcome in her home. ( even if it\\'s just for one night) \\r\\nThe room we stayed in was nice and clean, the rest of the house is also beautiful.\\r\\nIn the morning we ate a real american breakfast,what tasted delicious! \\r\\nFor everyone who is planning a trip to Nashville...stay at Michelles place! You wont regret it :-)  Michele and Collier were lovely hosts. Their warm welcome made my stay in Nashville feel like visiting family. Spent one whole afternoon just swinging in the hammock on the porch! Loved being on the park and walking distance to five points. Thanks so much for the great referrals - the food in Nashville is terrific. I had a wonderful stay at Michele\\'s. She and her husband were great hosts and I felt I completely at home there. The home is comfortable, inviting, and in a really cute neighborhood. The location is great as well--an easy walk to interesting shops, bars, and restaurants in East Nashville and a quick bus ride to Downtown. I\\'ll definitely be booking a room here on my next trip to Nashville. Michele and Collier are the ideal Airbnb hosts! Kind, gracious, and accommodating - there is no doubt we would return to their Airbnb. The location itself is within perfect biking/scootering distance to downtown, and the house is charming and beautiful. Michele and Collier are clearly involved and knowledgable about their community, and it was a pleasure to talk with them and learn about the area. Highly recommend! Michele is wonderful and the house is very cute and in a nice neighborhood.  They also have one of the cutest cats I\\'ve ever encountered, a little orange one that wags its tail like a dog!  We were only able to stay one night, but will definitely return the next time we are in Nashville. Great location and our hosts couldn\\'t have been nicer.  This is where we look forward to staying on our next trip to Nashville! We had a great first experience with AirBNB with Collier and Michele at Nashville Charm. The room wasn\\'t the exact room as listed but was very comfortable and met our needs. They were very friendly and helpful with information about the area . Their animals were very friendly too, made us feel right at home. We especially loved that a park backed up to their backyard and from their house we were able to hop on our bicycles and tour Nashville downtown or take some trails and ride for as many miles as we liked. The price was great. I can only add to the long list: Michele is a wonderful host, the house is so charming, quiet, the room is lovely, with a good bed, love the neighborhood. There\\'s a porch with a hammock and swinging chair. Great breakfasts. Michele took the time to give me hints about places to go, and they were awesome. Oh, and the animals are trained to make you feel super welcome. Michele and her family were great hosts! I felt at home there. Great location close enough to walk downtown if you want. The bus stop to town is a block away. Will stay there next trip to Nashville.  How many superlatives can I conjure up to describe our experience?\\r\\nTruly exceptional people. Extraordinary spirit of hospitality, generosity, and reciprocity to the max. Earth Mother Michele gets up and creates delicious, nutritious breakfast food from scratch. Not only for us, but she wrapped up a \\'care package\\' and sent it with us to our family members who were staying in a different nearby Airbnb. We enjoyed interacting with Michele and Collier; they just give, give, give. They open their home and themselves to others in a rare way. \\r\\nThe morning we left, once again she made a breakfast not only for us, but one to take for the others as well, giving us a generous \\'to go\\' package for all of us, for the road. Thank you for a delightful stay. Michelle was a wonderful host!! Our first night we checked in at 4:30am and Michelle greeted us at the door with a hug.  She made delicious baked goods for breakfast and was full of great advice for where to eat and visit while in Nashville. Her house is beautiful and colorful and you immediately feel at home there. It was a wonderful first airbnb experience.   The house was charming and precious.  Although the room we stayed in was not the one in the picture, it was incredibly cozy and comfortable.  Michele was welcoming and gave us tips on local restaurants and things we might want to do.  She was a generous host and even whomped up some homemade biscuits for us in the morning! We had a lovely time in her home. I will stay here again when I\\'m next traveling to Nashville.  A week ago I had the pleasure of staying with the Flynn\\'s for my first Airbnb experience and I couldn\\'t have asked for a better stay. The home is located in a cute, unique neighborhood and is only a few miles from downtown Nashville. I was traveling with my aunt and upon arrival felt welcomed. The house is very well kept and has a lot of character. We right away noticed the beautiful front porch swing and sitting area. Our room was a good size and very comfortable. Michelle had towels and necessities laid out, freshly made beds and an empty closet and drawers to store our things. After showing us around, Michelle told us  about the area, answered our questions about transportation and gave us suggestions for activities based on our interests. She drew a map with a few hot spots and then gave us our first ride to downtown Nashville. \\r\\nDuring our stay, we were comfortable going and returning at our leisure. In the mornings, the Flynn\\'s had a delicious breakfast prepared each day, one being pancakes and fruit and Sunday\\'s breakfast an amazing spread of fresh vegetables and potatoes, eggs, fresh baked bread and more. There was never any pressure or time restraint which made it even more  pleasant and relaxing. During our stay they had one other guest and everyone was enjoyable to talk with and considerate. I definitely feel like it added to our trip. Although around breakfast time it was nice to talk and relax, there was plenty of room and my aunt and I never had a problem with space.  There were two bathrooms that were easily accessible and the Flynn\\'s made us feel welcome to relax in the kitchen and sitting areas if desired. \\r\\nThe Flynn\\'s were wonderful hosts and I am so thankful we were able to stay with them for our long weekend in Nashville. We had the freedom to have our own agenda, while also feeling as though we were staying with friends in a safe and kind environment. \\r\\n We had a fabulous experience. Michele and her husband are fantastic hosts. The house is charming next to a park and in a quiet, lovely neighborhood in East Nashville. It was nice also to be greeted in the morning with a yummy breakfast.\\r\\nIt couldn\\'t be more perfect, I highly recommend it ! Looking forward to coming back if ever I had to be in Nashville again.\\r\\n I can not say enough great things about my first Airbnb experience at Nashville Charm. Michele and her family were very warm and welcoming. The house is on a quiet street close to downtown and the interstate. I had a headache when I arrived and the next day so I laid in the hammock on the front porch for hours relaxing. Their animals are darling, especially the kitty, I had to refuse the urge to take her. The room was as described and cozy with fresh flowers and linens in the room. You are given a key to come and go as you please. Michele made suggestions for restaurants and offered to make me breakfast because she is too kind. :) I posted this link to my (Hidden by Airbnb) page and wish I could post some pictures on here as well that I took during my stay. Please do not hesitate to take advantage of this little treasure charm in Nashville.  Cheers, Carrie Michele and Collier are just as wonderful as all the reviews say!  One thing that we appreciated that has not been mentioned here yet is that this home is queer-friendly.  Besides that, these guys are great ambassadors for Nashville.  Michele was super welcoming, inviting us to homemade breakfast and conversation with her family and their dear friend.  We stayed for one night after a concert; Michele recommended things to do the following day and even helped orient us with a printed-out map.  Her colorful home is very comfortable, and it\\'s located in a great East Nashville neighborhood.  Highly recommended! \\r\\n Michele and her family were welcoming and made my stay seamless and relaxing. She made sure I had everything I needed or could want. The house was beautiful and colorful, and my room was perfect.  Our stay with Michelle in Nashville was delightful. She graciously waited for us even though we were hours delayed due to a tornado warning and hailstorm on the road (we drove from Washington D.C.) She was undoubtedly one of the most prepared hosts I\\'ve ever had-- she had maps, knows the essentials that guests need, have fantastic local food recommendations, and knows the local sights! The accommodations were nice and comfortable. She even made some delicious pancakes for breakfast! We had a fun time and recommend this place. My friend and I had a wonderful stay! Michele and Collier were warm, welcoming, and went out of their ways to make sure everything was all right for us. I love everything about their place: the decorations had character, the location was convenient, and the room was comfortable. I appreciate the restaurant/activity recommendations and great conversation. If I ever find myself in Nashville again, I\\'ll definitely stay with them again! It was an absolute pleasure to stay with Michele and Collier and their family. They were very understanding to my delayed travel plans. I enjoyed my stay although quite short but had great chats and a fab dancing night out with Michele.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe neighbourhood was fine and the bus is so close which was nice.  The room was a good size with 2 doors in and out. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe walls are thin so you do hear a lot but I had ear plugs and it was fine. \\r\\n\\r\\nWould live to see Michele and family again.  Our stay with Michele and family was GREAT! They welcomed us like family and where so nice to us and helpful! !! Lived the house ! My wife loved the colors and the way Michele had the house fixed!!! At the corner of her house was a bus stop which took us right downtown and saved us a big hassle too, I will be back to their house when I visit again !!! We had a great time at Michele\\'s.  We were very comfortable. Felt just like home.  The room was as described.  The distance to downtown Nashville was about 10 minutes.  We will be returning.  Michele made me feel very welcome in her lovely home - she\\'s an incredibly nice and helpful person. The room is spacious and beautiful, and so is the rest of the house, located just minutes away from downtown on the bus. Thank you so much for this experience! We only stayed a night at Michelle\\'s but it was really really great: the room and the whole apartment was very cozy, well-located (7-10 min drive from downtown), and we had a very interesting discussion with Michelle in the morning, when we could also enjoy the breakfast she prepared for us. Very much recommended! Michelle was an incredibly gracious, considerate and attentive host. She was very interesting to talk to and went out of her way to make sure I was taken care of. She was even able to pick me up from the station, which is invaluable in a city you don\\'t know and with a heaving backpack. She has a lovely house, incredibly warm and welcoming. My room in particular was very comfortable, big enough, with plenty of amenities like a working TV! I\\'d missed television. They have a wonderful garden that backs onto the vast Shelby Park. So it is in a great location for nature lovers! I was only here for a brief time but made to feel very much at home . Thank you! :) We had such a great time! Michele and Collier made us feel right at home. It was fun to just sit and talk with them about their lives and experiences over the wonderful breakfast they so graciously shared with us on Sunday morning. The room itself was quite comfortable and cozy, and the pets were very friendly. We will definitely check their availability first if we decide to spend more time in Nashville! What a wonderful stay we had ! We felt more then just like home, we felt like we were part of the family ! Michelle and her husband are such a sweet couple they welcomed us to their home so warmly. The beds were so comfortable we slept like babies, we fell in love with the place right away ! Would recommend this place to anyone who as a great heart, Michelle is very kind and giving please acknowledge it and be  thankful !!! Great home and host!  Michele is an incredibly sweet, knowledgeable, and hospitable host.  Her home is beautiful and warm and offered great accommodations within a close proximity to the main hubs of Nashville.  Highly recommended place and host!   I love Michele\\'s home! Its colorful and inviting, just like she is. The room is incredibly comfy, clean, and spacious. She gave me a tour, provided me with towels, the key, wifi code etc. She asked me what I like to eat for breakfast and when I woke up, there was hot tea, coffee cake and fresh fruit waiting for me. I also got to enjoy a conversation with her in the AM. She is incredibly warm and has a great sense of humor. I highly recommend her as a host.  I didn\\'t end up staying with Michelle because of a last minute travel issue but she was very kind and understanding. Our stay with Michele and Collier was more than we hoped for. They were so welcoming and warm it was really a pleasure to meet them and their family. Nothing was too much trouble. The house is full of life and character and we slept really well there. I\\'d recommend anyone thinking of staying in Nashville to choose this place, it\\'s in a really nice area and it\\'s easy to get into and around town. Can\\'t say enough good things about our hosts, thanks so much and the peach pie was lovely I couldn\\'t be happier with my stay at Michele\\'s. She and her family were very kind and accommodating. The location is amazing. I would stay here again in a second.  Michele é super adorável. Não tenho nada para reclamar sobre ela. Me deixou super confortável, me mostrou a casa e ainda deixou livre para se eu precisasse de algo da cozinha. Adorei conversar com ela e ela me deu muitas dicas legais da cidade e de lugares que eu poderia conhecer. Ainda fez um café da manhã delicioso e ficou à disposição para me ajudar mesmo depois que continuei minha viagem para outros lugares. Foi como uma verdadeira mãe por 2 dias. The host canceled this reservation 73 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. I enjoyed staying at Michele\\'s! She was welcoming and understanding when we called to let her know we might be later than expected. The room was comfortable and the location was close enough to downtown, but in a safe, quiet neighborhood with free parking. We will definitely stay here again! Une de mes meilleures experiences Airbnb. Michele a ete tres acceuillante. Elle nous a donne plein de bons conseils. Je recommande vivement. A++++++++ Michelle and Collier are simply lovely, welcoming individuals. Room was well appointed. Would definitely stay here again on my next trip to Nashville.  East Nashville was charming and an ideal location.   Michele was a very welcoming host. Right away, she was happy to give recommendations on getting around the city and popular places to eat. The room we stayed in was comfortable and we had a great stay! Michele and her husband Collier were so kind and welcoming. I could not have asked for a sweeter pair of hosts. Their home was beautiful and comfortable and the breakfasts were delicious. The bus stop for the bus you can take downtown is two doors away from their home and the buses are easy to use. \\r\\nThis was my first time using Airbnb and I wasn\\'t even sure how it worked but Michele took the time to coach me through. She and her family made my trip to Nashville a wonderful experience. Thank you so much!  Michele and her husband Collier were incredibly gracious hosts. My wife and I stayed with them for 3 nights and when we come back to Nashville, we will certainly be staying with them again!  It was great how much knowledge they had about Downtown, East Nashville, and their surrounding neighborhoods. They had an endless stream of suggestions for things to do and places to go!  We also had a great breakfast provided every day with fruit, juice, coffee, and home baked breakfast goods. If you\\'re heading to (Website hidden by Airbnb) yourself a favor and stay with these wonderful, accommodating people! Best air B&B experience ever.\\nMichele and Collier were such a wonderfull hosts and full of hospitality. It is a really nice place and so the neighborhood too. all the places Michell tell us to visit were great. \\nThe transport conection with the downtown is really close.\\nWe are so gratefull. If we come back to Nashville we definitley repeat here! The stay in Michelle\\'s was perfect. We were welcomed from the first moment and we felt at home. Their house is lovely and we could get downtown really easy by taxi. It was a great experience to meet people like Michelle in such a perfect place as Nashville.  From the moment I arrived at Michele\\'s, I felt like I was at home. She was so kind and invited me in with open arms. She was beyond flexible when my plans constantly changed throughout my 5 night stay. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe room was great! Everything was just as described, if not better. Comfortable bed, fresh linens, and plenty of space for all my belongings I brought along. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor being in a big city, the neighborhood was quiet, yet convenient to everywhere I needed to go. Michele offered great suggestions for places to eat, things to see, etc. \\r\\n\\r\\nMy first airbnb experience was a success because of Michele. I will definitely be doing it again and if I return to Nashville, I would stay in her home again in a heartbeat! Michelle and her husband are great hosts. Very nice, friendly and accomodating. The room and bathroom are aslo very clean and bed is comfortable. If you are an animal lover there is a dog and a cat there also to provide some entertainment  Michele was a thoroughly lovely and warm host. My sister and I enjoyed chatting with her and her daughter and hearing about their travels. She couldn\\'t have been more generous (a beautiful breakfast our first morning!) and understanding (we left a bit after the check-out time -- sorry again!). The room was extremely comfortable and the pets were very sweet. Couldn\\'t have hoped for a better stay! We really had a good time with Michele and her husband Collier. They welcomed us and Michele took care of the communication for timing and direction. The room is clean and comfortable, with Wifi and television. Unfortunately Michele had to leave for family reason, but we stayed with Collier and their cute dog Scout and their beautiful red cat. We got coffee for breakfast and we, had a very nice conversation with Collier during our breakfast the second day, he even offered us some eggs. The neighborhood is quite and very close, by car, to the city center and Gran Ole Opry. We surely recommend to stay here!  Michèle nous ayant prévenue qu\\'elle serait absente de 18h à 20h, nous sommes arrivés vers 17h. Elle n\\'était pas là. La maison était très mal indiquée et en travaux, les vitres étant calfeutrées. Nous avons eu l\\'impression d\\'une maison inhabitée. J\\'ai demandé \"Michèle\" et une jeune fille lui a téléphoné pour qu\\'elle vienne nous accueillir. En fait, cette jeune fille nous a fait visiter la maison car Michèle est arrivée plus tard. Les renseignements que Michèle nous avait demandé auparavant pour rendre notre séjour agréable (restaurant où nous pourrions écouter de la musique) sont rester lettre morte.\\r\\nLa chambre correspond à la vue du site, mais le cabinet de toilette au RDC est partagé et ne ferme pas à clef. En rentrant du restaurant vers 21h30, personne ne nous a accueilli, la maison semblait vide.\\r\\nLe petit déjeuner était prévu à 8h00. Notre ponctualité ne fut pas récompensée car dans la cuisine, seule une assiette vide nous attendait avec un mot pour aller chercher Michèle dans le jardin. Nous sommes allés chercher Michèle dans le jardin qui discutait avec les ouvriers. Au final, Michèle nous a donné du café en grains,   le moulin et l\\'eau chaude. J\\'ai du demander le lait et si je pouvais avoir un jus de fruit. Elle m\\'indiqua le frigo. Pour manger, on a eu seulement un gâteau ( bourratif et sans saveur), mais en fait, il était prévu pour les ouvriers qu\\'elle s\\'empressa de leur apporter. Un chien qui aboyait sans cesse et un chat qui se colle à vous. Nous sommes partis et Michèle ne nous à même pas accompagné devant la voiture. Cette accueil ne correspond absolument pas à un accueil B&B. Michele is a great host and a very nice person.We had wonderful conversations, got very good advice, enjoyed great homecooked breakfasts and had a nice room with a comfortable bed. The five airbnb stars are just not enough for this place. Staying with Michelle was my first ever Airbnb experience and I have to say it was wonderful. It can be scary trying something new and I was worried that it would feel awkward staying in another persons home. But Michelle was an absolute sweetheart and made me feel very welcome and comfortable. Her house is so lovely and cosy. The location was perfect, it\\'s a quiet neighbourhood but also very cool and artsy with indie shops and unique bars and restaurants. It was nice not seeing the usual commercial American chain stores and restaurants. I felt very safe wondering around by myself. It is also nice n close to downtown and has easy transportation. My only problem with my stay is that I didn\\'t stay long enough!! Thank you Michelle, I would definitely like to visit Nashville and stay with you again!  Wonderful people and a very cosy and safe accommodation. The cat is adorable and will make you feel even better. Anytime again. This stay was fabulous! Michele and her family made me feel so comfortable..I was traveling through nashville just for the night and I felt very safe and cared for (she even brewed me some fresh coffee after my long drive!).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe home is in a great location in a really great neighborhood just a short uber ride away. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would highly recommend this place! I had a wonderful time staying at Michele\\'s home.  Everything was perfect.  The space, location, and cost was perfect.  I would highly recommend staying here if you\\'re in Nashville. Michele was extremely welcoming and very helpful with information about Nashville. The room was excellent and as described. Michele and Collier were an absolute treat to stay with. Their house was warm, inviting and (very) bright. :)\\r\\nThey were the definition of southern charm. So kind and sweet. \\r\\nPerfect location! Very close to down town and a beautiful park. Their street was quiet. \\r\\n I visited with my boyfriend and we had SUCH a great time! Michele and Collier are wonderful hosts, very thoughtful and helpful, and Michele made the best cobbler and muffins!!! The house is comfortable and backs against a beautiful park, while giving easy access to five points and east Nashville. Fully recommend!!!! I want to come back. Our stay with Michele and her family was very lovely. Her house was clean and very beautifully colored. Our stay was very welcoming and Michele was quick to offer any accommodations. She had a lot of info on what to do in Nashville as well. In the morning she even made a coffee cake. We loved our stay! Michele was an awesome hostess! She was very knowledgeable and willing to help us navigate through the large city of Nashville and provide suggestions for activities. She also provided delicious breakfasts and coffee for us before we started our day, which was very kind of her. The location was easy to find, conveniently close to downtown Nashville, and near a beautiful park. The room we rented was clean and comfortable, and we were overall exceptionally happy with our stay. Staying at Michele’s made our Nashville experience very pleasant and memorable.\\r\\n We had such an amazing time staying with Michele and her family. They made us feel so welcome, and went out of their way to offer advice and assistance to make our stay in Nashville a memorable experience. The room was really comfortable and clean and so was the bathroom. It\\'s in a great neighbourhood in Nashville, with amazing places to eat, drink and relax close by. Also, it\\'s so easy to get downtown and back on the bus, which stops a couple of houses down. Highly recommended for anyone wishing to stay in the great city if Nashville. This was my first airbnb experience and it was wonderful! Michelle and her family made my sister and I feel welcome as soon as we arrived. We had great conversations and she gave us many suggestions on where to eat/visit. The room was big and very comfortable for 2 people. The house is beautifully decorated and very clean. The location is perfect, lots of good places to eat and close(but not too close!) to downtown Nashville. It was an easy drive to downtown, the Grand Ole Opry and the airport. We both enjoyed the family kitty and sweet dog. We were offered fresh coffee every morning and had use of the kitchen. I can\\'t say enough good things about our experience at Nashville Charm. We entered as strangers and left as friends!  I loved my stay at Michele\\'s house in East Nashville. Back when I lived in the area, I spent a lot of time on the eastside so I really enjoyed this quaint and cozy little house right next to Shelby park and super close to everything Nashville has to offer. Michele and her family were really friendly and helpful. I\\'d never used airbnb before now and I\\'m so glad that this room was my first experience; it was exactly what I needed after long days spent visiting old friends. I definitely would love to stay here again next time I\\'m in town! Nice place in quiet area. Very attentive friendly hosts. Was met at door by Michele who gave me a tour of the house.  She was always available for help if needed. Loved the relaxed atmosphere there. Michele and her husband were wonderful hosts! We really enjoyed staying in their home and getting to meet them. It is located in an amazing spot in East Nashville that has a wonderful park right down the street (Shelby Park) and is close to some really great restaurants. We would recommend Michele\\'s home to anyone visiting East Nashville :) A colorful experience, in looks as well as in atmosphere. A warm welcome and lots of super handy tips for getting around! Two lovely pets (the cat especially was sweet) and a nice comfy bedroom. Everything we needed was there. This is a room I would definitely recommend! My wife and I had a wonderful, first AirBNB experience in Michele\\'s home. She was warm and welcoming and made us feel right at home. Love the new paint job on the outside of the house! Need a picture! We were on a visit to see our daughter who is a student at Vanderbilt, and it was an easy 15 minute drive across town to the University without having to get on the interstate. Lots of good restaurants nearby and we loved having the park behind the house.  We were able to enjoying exercising/walking in a beautiful, safe place. Michele (and Collier) were very enjoyable to talk to, but also were quite understanding that we needed to be able to come and go. We will definitely hope to stay there again on a return visit. I\\'m lucky to have stayed here! It was a beautiful spot with a wonderful host! \\r\\n\\r\\nBooking was easy and straight to the point, communication prior to arriving was good and I was warmly welcomed when I arrived. Michele was wonderful! She gave me a quick tour of the room/space and asked if I drank coffee/tea in the mornings. She was very knowledgeable of the area and gave helpful tips on how to navigate Nashville. She gave great recommendations for local food spots! \\r\\n\\r\\nHer home is warm and welcoming. The room was clean and comfy. I felt right at home and enjoyed my stay! My friend and I felt extremely welcome and comfortable at Michele\\'s home. We were in a private room with a shared bath, but never ran into any conflicts with using the facilities. The neighborhood was AMAZING! She provided us with suggestions of places to shop and eat (you MUST eat at Mas Tacos Porfavor and the Pharmacie Burger place). When I go back to Nashville, I will definitely stay with them again! I cannot say enough about what a great experience this was. Staying with Michele was a fantastic Airbnb experience! The house was eclectic and cozy and in a fun neighborhood, and very accessible to downtown. The pullout futon was comfy and I loved hanging with Scout the dog and her adorable kitty. You will be happy that you stayed here! Michele\\'s Nashville Charm home was lovely and Michele herself was so welcoming and helpful. She greeted us at the door, helped us decide on where to eat and visit in downtown. It was a perfect place to  stop on my cross country drive!  Michele was great host. She made us feel at home and gave a lot of tips about where to go, what to see etc. Her house is very special, cute and colorfull. And she has an adorable cat! Staying with Michele and her family was an amazing experience!\\r\\nShe is a very welcoming and warm person. She goes through incredible lengths to make you confortable. She is a generous person.\\r\\nHer house is exactly like on the description. Very easy to find and in a safe and nice neighbourhood. It is a colourful and well furnished place!\\r\\nAnd there is a lot of things to do in Nashville Michele took the time to explain to us.   This was an amazing place to stay! Michele and her family made me feel so welcome--it was almost like they were my family away from home! They truly have the gift of hospitality and know how to integrate you into their family, so you feel welcome, and like part of the group. This was actually my biggest concern, because this was my first time using Airbnb, and I wasn\\'t certain how it was going to be staying with a family that had their own lives and schedules. But everything worked out better than I could have ever imagined.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy second biggest concern was transportation, because I was attending a conference downtown and I wasn\\'t certain how far East Nashville was from downtown. So you can imagine my joy when I discover the bus stops at the corner by Michele\\'s house, which meant going downtown was fairly quick and costs less than $2.00! The bus, combined with how nice this room was, has to make this the best place to stay in Nashville. Given the affordability, you are better off staying here and spending your money on some good food and sightseeing!\\r\\n\\r\\nHere are some random pieces of information: \\r\\n\\r\\n1. An Uber from the airport to Michele\\'s costs around $20.00. \\r\\n\\r\\n2. There is a nice selection of restaurants that you can walk to from Michele\\'s place in 30 minutes or less (which is probably less than a 5 minute Uber ride).\\r\\n\\r\\n3. I am not sure if this applies to everyone who stays at Michele\\'s, but I had a private bathroom during my stay.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. If I am ever in Nashville again, this would be my first choice of accommodations!\\r\\n\\r\\n5. Michele and her family have a gift of hospitality, and I think this is what makes staying with them so great! This is a home that you walk into and hope that one day your home grows up to be like it. Colorful,  warm,  comfortable,  friendly, and full of stories.   Michele and Collier are delightful to chat with, and the room is cozy and has everything you need.  Morning sun is bright in the room,  so bring an eye mask if you need darkness, but that\\'s an easy price to pay for such a nice space. I enjoyed my short stay with Michelle and her family. I was only there for less than 12 hours, but it was the most comfortable stay I\\'ve had on the road in a long time. She was a wonderful hostess helping me feel right at home, I just wish I had had more time to visit. Next trip to Nashville I would love to stay here again.  Great host!! Michele and her husband Collier were very friendly and most informative. The accommodation was great and the area was wonderful. A beautiful, peaceful, eclectic home to stay in. Close to lots of things, and Michele will give you great tips of places to go and things to eat around Nashville. We loved the city and would have loved to stay longer. The accommodations were excellent. The house is clean and artsy, and the room itself is spacious and comfy. Michele and her husband were great hosts - they were so welcoming and gave good recommendations on things to do. The location is fantastic - in a quiet neighborhood next to a park but you can be in the downtown in minutes. Incredible value for the price - would highly recommend. Michele and Collier were so friendly and gave us good clues for the short time we had in Nashville. \\r\\nWe fell very welcome. Thanks:-) We felt welcome at \"Nashville Charm\" before we even arrived. Michele responded to all of my emails so quickly and warmly. We had a late arrival into Nashville and Michele and Collier were both waiting up for us. Michele greeted me with a hug and gave us a quick tour of the home so we would be familiar with the \\'lay of the land\\'. We saw Michele briefly the next morning and then were able to enjoy a little longer visit our last evening. Our visits were always easy. The house was clean and comfortable and had fun touches every where. There was a lovely park out back which we sadly never got to enjoy due to rain and early departures most days. The neighborhood was quiet and the house is near downtown Nashville so the location was perfect. We really enjoyed our stay! Michele is a wonderful, welcoming host.  Her home is beautiful and very comfortable.  I felt like I was staying with good friends I\\'d known a long time.  I loved the neighborhood too, and the nearby Shelby Park.  Michele recommended great restaurants to try that were close by.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis was my first Airbnb experience.  I will definitely be back to stay at Michele\\'s home, and I would like to try Airbnb other cities as well.    I love the feeling of staying with a family rather than being on my own in a lonely hotel.   This was our first Airbnb experience and it will be a hard one to top!\\r\\nMichele and her husband welcomed us into their lovely, colorful home and, after showing us our room, gave some excellent recommendations for restaurants and entertainment.  We wished we had booked several nights!   We loved staying with Michele and Collier. They were our 1 experience with airbnb last year and we just had to come back. They are very warm and welcoming hosts and I would recommend them to anyone. It was my first time ever staying at an airbnb. It far exceeded my expectations! The house was great! Really cute and close to the city! We didn\\'t get to spend much time in the house because we were attending a conference but Michelle and her family were so nice and very accommodating! We loved our trip! Would highly recommend this place to anyone. A VERY nice place for how affordable it was. Love our time in Nashville! Would definitely come back here if I ever got the chance.  Michele was great. Very warm and welcoming when we arrived. Michele and her husband have a beautiful home. Our room was extremely clean and had plenty of room. Michele had other guests and a family member staying at the same time but we didn\\'t meet them only in passing. The house was in a lovely neighborhood and a short drive to downtown making a perfect location. I would highly recommend Michele as a host.   We had an excellent stay at Michelle\\'s. The house is big (our room too !!!), full of colours and happiness. A very warm and friendly welcome, best fresh breakfast muffins we ever had, we would come back anytime :) Our stay was our first AirBnB experience and we very pleased. Michelle and her husband welcomed us into their home, making us feel comfortable. We highly recommend a stay here. Thank you!  Thanks for your hospitality! Everything was perfect. We really appreciated our stay. Michelle and her husband were so kind to us. The kind of people you want to meet in a trip...  A warm welcome!! Lovely home on a beautiful park with a great walk path! Hosts very knowledgeable about Nashville and accommodating in helping make dinner decisions and plan evening out! Will definitely stay again.. Michele greeted us at the door with a warm hug and welcomed us into her beautiful home. Located in a great neighbourhood with a beautiful park as her back garden we wish we could have stayed longer. The room is cosy and comfortable and we slept incredibly well. The real highlight of our stay was sitting down and having a chat with Michele and her family, who were fun, interesting and full of amazing recommendations of things to see, do and especially eat in Nashville. We definitely plan to come back one day! It Was a great place to stay. Comfy.. clean, A very warm feeling about being there. Just to walk around the neighborhood was great. Michele is an absolutely phenomenal host. She is warm and gracious and her cozy and vibrant home reflects that aura perfectly. Pre-arrival communication was clear and prompt. I\\'d recommend this Airbnb to my friends in a heartbeat. Loved our time with Michele and her family, great location with the city close by and the park next door and everyone was so accommodating and happy to share tips about local restaurants and activities (and cake!).  Lovely rooms and beds, good sleeps all round. Thankyou Michele :)  My wife and I have enjoyed our stay with Michele and her husband both times we have came to Nashville,  we love the location and we love her house, if your a reader like me you will also love their book collection!  Michele is always very gracious and nice, wonderful people and a wonderful place Gracious and helpful family, darling accommodations, comfie futon, great location, welcome morning coffee..... Close to downtown, but out enough to be peaceful. Nice being near Shelby Bottoms for walking and picked up a bike share there to ride the 3 miles to town. Took the bus back with a stop only a couple of blocks away. Highly recommend! Michele made us feel most welcome. We loved the house and the colorful paint colors. Our room was very comfortable and we slept so well. Michele helped us with recommendations and directions to some  great local spots, and she even made us coffee and tea in the morning. We loved staying here and want to return. It was such a pleasure to be here.. Thank you for the wonderful stay! Highly recommend staying here to anyone looking for a great, flexible, welcoming family. My girlfriend and I spent the weekend in Nashville and were so glad we got the chance to meet Michele and Collier and stay at this adorable home in a great location. Walking distance to cute area of Nashville, Five Points,  and short drive to downtown. The room was perfect and you have your own bathroom which was very convenient. Great home!!!   Michelle was lovely and went out of her way to make us feel welcome. Her home and conversation were great Michele was such an incredible host! So accommodating and helpful. She had great recommendations of local restaurants and had coffee ready for us every morning. The house was very cute and cozy. The room was perfect for what we needed. The location was perfect! Very close and easily accessible to downtown as well as a lot of other areas in Nashville. The house itself is on a very quiet and safe street right near a park that has a walking trail. Overall, a really great trip! We will definitely be back! Michele and her husband are so nice and warm hearted, the room is comfortable and with great space! We loved our stay here! Right from the start, Michele made us feel at home. She gave us local restaurant tips and directions into the city. The location worked out perfectly and turned out out to be only a $6 Uber ride to downtown Nashville. Would 100% recommend.  We couldn\\'t have felt more at home during our stay.  Michele graciously shared her love of Nashville and all of her recommendations were fabulous.  Our space was airy and welcoming. I don\\'t know where to begin.. I was traveling by myself and due to weather my trip was cut short by a day :( When I did arrive, my luggage did not, but have no fear, Michele and her Family came to the rescue. They were so accommodating to my desperate needs and made sure that I was well taken care of and in good hands. My Negative Nancy mood did not affect their spirits and they truly went above and beyond to make me feel welcome and comfortable in their sweet home and they continued to lift my own spirit. They were flexible to my outings and always made sure I was aware if they were going to be away. The room was large and open and the bed was comfortable. I never felt like I had to lock myself in the room and continue to be by myself. It was super easy to have a conversation with their family and I can\\'t wait to be back and stay there again. I know I would even stop by for a visit as I feel apart of their Nashville Family now :) I give their Home and Hospitality 10 Stars and I highly recommend. Michele was so warm and welcoming. Her family made us feel at home right away. Absolutely beautiful space, creatively decorated. Truly a pleasure to stay here. The shower was AMAZING. The beds were really comfortable. The airbnb space is sunny, clean, homey room on the top floor. They were really gracious about letting us use the kitchen and left us coffee out each morning. Easy access to Five Points area and a short drive to other awesome downtown locations.\\r\\nSeriously an outstanding host and outstanding Airbnb! Michele and her family provided wonderful hospitality. Their home is warm and extremely welcoming so you feel cozy right away. She had great recommendations as it was my first time in Nashville. Though I couldn\\'t stay long Michele definitely helped provide an amazing experience that will go down in the books for my road trip. I look forward to visiting them again someday!  Everything was perfect. Wonderful people, wonderful home, wonderful location. Thank you so much for making my stay in Nashville very special! Michele and Collier went above and beyond to welcome us into their amazing home. The room was huge and super clean, we felt very cozy and comfortable. They were great conversationalists and had lots of information about the neighbourhood and the history of the area. We loved staying here and will definitely be back the next time we visit Nashville! Michele was very welcoming and generously oriented me around the neighborhood, as well as ensuring that my travel needs and desires were supported by any information she could provide. We had a \"once in five years\" snowstorm, so everyone\\'s plans were upended, and it all came together just fine. Collier\\'s morning coffee was kind and homey. I really enjoyed the animals in the house (two dogs and a cat named Serendipity) and the beautiful back to the house set against the park. While the Nashville weather was more variable than I had planned for : ) Michele even put out an array of coats and hats and gloves so all were geared up for the snowstorm, and we even went sledding. Michele had her eye out for what might be needed and explained how the houseflow best worked for them. Overall a great temporary homebase for me during the time I spent, with a good balance for me of local helpfulness (what\\'s on), human kindness, and space to do my own thing. Busline at the corner, and there\\'s a solid coffee shop two blocks down if you need to get work done during the day, or space, while the host family is being social with their friends.  I\\'m grateful I landed here; it was just what I needed then, and I recommend! Michele and Collier were the most incredible hosts we could have asked for. They\\'re house felt like home for our 4 days there and they were so helpful with giving us all the information we needed- transport, things to do, local happenings. The beds were so comfortable, the bus into town left literally 20steps from the front door and we had all we needed to cook our meals. Although we got snowed inane had to extend our stay, they were so accommodating while we got ourself sorted. Such warm, fun and friendly people (not to mention the cutest cat and dog!). I would definitely recommend you stay here!!  We had a great time in Nashville. Michele was a fantastic host. The location was perfect for us, my daughter especially liked the running trail accessible right out the back door. The house is beautiful. There is a super friendly cat we wanted to take home with us! This is a great place to stay. Michele went out of her way to make us feel totally welcome and at home. We greatly enjoyed out stay here! The house is full of character and very comfy and clean! Sadly we had to cut our trip short because of bad weather, and Michele handled it beautifully. We highly recommend this living space to anyone who wants to check out the Nashville area! Michele was very kind and flexible. It was our first time in Nashville and she made us feel at home. Great recommendations, loved the space, and in a cool part of town. We walked to several neat shops and there were plenty good restaurants within walking or short driving distance. Next time we\\'ll stay longer!  We had a wonderful stay in Nashville with Michele and her family. The house was in a perfect location, within easy biking distance from downtown. The room was spacious, clean, and very comfortable. We most appreciated all of the great recommendations Michele had for us during our visit. Overall a great experience  What a delight! Michele and Collier made us feel like family in their gorgeous historic home. Great conversation, yet we had our own privacy too. The place itself backs up to the gigantic park, perfect for biking and walking. A lovely neighborhood too! The room was very comfortable and was the perfect launch pad to our Nashville adventure. Hope to return! Our stay with Michele was absolutely lovely. She is the nicest person. It was very comfortable and her house is the cutest house you have ever seen!! It is perfect distance to downtown Nashville. We would definitely stay there again!!! We had a wonderful stay at Michele\\'s home. She was incredibly, kind, welcoming, and hospitable. She had great recommendations for things to do in Nashville and areas to see. The location was perfect: a running trail right in the backyard, a short walk from a neat area of town, and a short drive from downtown Nashville. I highly recommend to anybody looking to experience Music City like a local! This was my first time using Airbnb and it was a great experience! Michele was an absolutely wonderful host! We were greeted by her and the family\\'s dog, Scout. Michele made sure that we were comfortable in the house and offered to help with any questions. The house is beautiful and located in a very nice neighborhood with a park directly behind the house. We had our own space and bathroom, both of which were comfortable and clean. The main bedroom has a small room off to the side with another (super comfy) bed! One great aspect of the space was personal control over heating and cooling of the room. There was also a kitty who was always up for a snuggly afternoon nap.  The house is in East Nashville and is only a short drive (about 5 minutes) to a variety of great restaurants. It took us about 15 minutes to get downtown and driving/traffic in Nashville wasn\\'t bad at all.  They are so friendly!! And the room I lived in is so clean and comfortable that is exactly as the picture shows. I love it so much! Went with my girlfriend for two nights- great location in a good neighborhood. Michele wasnt there but her daughter Kezee was so nice and welcoming. Close to some great breakfast spots, beautiful scenery around and overall a great experience. Their cat, seren is one of the sweetest cats ive ever encountered. Would definetely recommend! Michele and her home were amazing! It was a very convenient location with walkable things to do. The home itself is lovely, and all amenities were available. Overall, I had a great time and would definitely stay with them again next time I\\'m in Nashville.  Michele was super sweet!  The house was super cute and in a great location.  Michele was very helpful in giving us hints and tips about Nashville. My mom and I really enjoyed staying here. :) Michele was an excellent host. She knows her stuff. She gave us recommendations and a history of the neighborhood, and Nashville in general. The house is very cute. Looks quaint and cute from the outside, and very spacious on the inside. We had our own bedroom and bathroom. We weren\\'t at the house too much. She gave us a balance of giving us our space and engaging in interesting, endearing conversations. The dogs and cat are so cute! Loved the animals. Highly recommend staying here.  Michele und Collier sind unkomplizierte und sehr sympathische, interessante Gastgeber in einem wunderschönen Haus. Wir waren leider nur zwei Nächste dort, sonst hätten wir sie gerne noch näher kennengelernt. Das Haus liegt schön und ruhig, aber trotzdem zentral. Guter Coffeshop und Pizza-Spot in der nähe!  Michele was an exemplary hostess—very welcoming, kind and generous. We found much to share and talk about, as we experienced a true connection.  My husband and I felt like we were visiting a trusted friend.  Our room was large, lovely and comfortable. Michele was very knowledgeable about Nashville and her neighborhood and made some great suggestions for nearby restaurants that we enjoyed. Her dog “Scout” and cat “Seren” were friendly and adorable additions to a warm atmosphere & husband Collier makes great coffee!  Michele was not only generous with her space, her time and her recommendations, she’s truly a generous spirit and we hope to stay with her again. Michele is an amazing host!! I can\\'t thank her enough so kind and lovely!\\n I stayed here with a friend and we have had an amazing time! \\nMichele gave us the best information and had maps and bus time tables at the ready for us to use, Nashville is only a short bus ride away and the neighbourhood has all the amenities you could need a short walk away. Michele was a great host! She was very accommodating and hospitable. The house was very comfortable, cute and clean. Michele was an absolutely fantastic host! The house / room is exactly as described and the location couldn\\'t be better. Michele made me feel incredibly welcome in her home. The room itself is huge with beautiful huge windows with a lovely view, and the private bathroom is a definite plus. Everything was very easy, easygoing, and enjoyable. 100% recommended! I couldn\\'t more highly recommend staying with Michele and Collier (her husband)! Anyone who is looking for a comfy, cozy, welcoming, clean, and comforting place to stay while in Nashville has to consider Michele\\'s home. Before arriving in Nahsville, Michele was prompt and quick when communicating with me and finding a schedule that worked for the both of us. She also provided me with thorough answers to all my traveling questions and TONS of advice about places to visit and see in the city. When I arrived at her home, I was struck by how beautiful, charming, and welcoming it was. Not only is the neighborhood quiet and feels safe, but Michele\\'s house in particular has a charm unlike any I\\'ve ever experienced. Everything is so clean and we had all the amenities we needed provided to us, plus full use of shared spaces like the porch, kitchen, and living rooms. The home decorations were beautiful, and there were many animals staying in the home that made the experience feel even more home-y (if that\\'s even possible!). Plus, there is an absolutely beautiful park with walking trails and a small lake right behind Michele\\'s house that\\'s great for getting away to some peace and serenity. Now, about Michele specifically, I couldn\\'t say enough amazing things. She made me feel like family in her home, and I knew I could count on her for advice, answers to questions, or just good conversation. My visit to Nashville wouldn\\'t have been nearly the same if I hadn\\'t stayed in her home! Plus, something that speaks to Michele\\'s character and welcoming spirit is the fact that she welcomed me with open arms into her weekly family Sunday brunch after I found myself alone in the city on Sunday. It was such a special experience to participate in a welcoming and home cooked meal while learning about a family different from my own and sharing my own stories. This was one of the most memorable pieces of my vacation. Plus, Michele makes excellent biscuits!!! This was my first experience with Airbnb while traveling, but I couldn\\'t more highly recommend it. I\\'m sure my experience was so great because of Michele and Collier (I\\'m sorry that many aren\\'t so lucky), but if given the chance to be welcomed into their home, do it! You will not regret it. The next time I am in Nashville (obviously there will be a next time!), I will be staying with Michele and Collier again. Until then, I\\'ll be highly recommending that everyone I know make their way to visit Michele, her home, and her family. What can we say? This was by far our absolute favourite air BnB experience! From the moment we booked, Michelle went above and beyond to do everything she could to assist us. She is such a warm, wonderful and generous person and host as well as her lovely husband Collier who we spend lots of time chatting to. It honestly felt like coming home in the evenings when returning to their wonderful home. The house was amazing, so homely and clean and had everything we could need. We stayed in both bedrooms listed and both had extremely comfortable futon beds. Michelle would even lay out our favourite tea each morning for us. The dogs and cat were an added bonus and we\\'re all so lovely we spent so much time playing with them! The location was amazing, in such a quiet and safe residential area we would walk around most nights and felt completely comfortable. East Nashville is an amazing neighbourhood and there are so many lovely local shops and cafes within walking distance. It is also only a short uber ride from downtown but we like walking so we walked in most times and it took about 45-50 minutes. We can\\'t thank Michelle and Collier enough for their wonderful hospitality and for making our stay in Nashville one to remember. We cannot recommend this place highly enough to anyone wanting to stay in Nashville! I had a great stay in Nashville. Michele was a wonderful host and very welcoming. I\\'d definitely recommend a visit! Wow we\\'re not sure where to start! We just had the best time staying with Michele and Collier in Nashville. We arrived weary after a long flight and we were greeted so warmly. We turned the corner into the street and just the sight of their gorgeous house made us go \\'wow!\\' It\\'s a bright, happy and wonderful place to stay. They have a beautiful dog and cat who are just adorable - we absolutely fell in love with Scout the dog. The space is wonderful, the room is so spacious and comfortable. You can come and go as you please, but we really enjoyed arriving back and chatting to Michele and Collier - such wonderfully warm good people. They were kind enough to make us breakfast and offer drinks which was really welcome. Basically - we loved every second and we were really sad to leave! We really hope to visit again one day. Thank you guys xx Michele is a wonderful, warm and welcoming host! She was flexible and communicative about check in time, as ours and her plans changed. Once we arrived, Michele was so helpful and knowledgeable about things to do in Nashville as well as ways to get around easily. The location could not have been better, there were tons of things to walk to and places to see!  Had a lovely visit in Michele\\'s home! It was a quick stop for me on the way somewhere else the next day so I wasn\\'t able to take advantage of the various amenities like the nearby walking trails. I arrived later in the evening but they were there to greet me and gave me a thorough tour of their home, including a refrigerator for my use - what a thoughtful touch! Bedroom was clean and comfortable and I slept very well. Would definitely stay here again.  What a wonderful experience. Michelle and her home are amazing. Pasted my expectations! East Nashville right by this park. I would go to Nashville agin just to stay here again.   This was my first Airbnb experience, and it was fantastic! Michele was out-of-town, so unfortunately we did not meet in person, but she was great about coordinating my arrival with her daughter Keezee and her husband Collier, who were both extremely welcoming and helpful. The room was spacious, and I was provided a private bathroom. Everything was as described in the listing, and I felt very much at home. They have 2 adorable dogs and 1 cat as well! I highly recommend staying at Michele and Collier\\'s the next time you visit Nashville.   It was an absolute pleasure to stay with Michele and her family. The home was easy to locate, and parking was a breeze directly in front of the house. The home was large and comfortable. The room was bright, sunny, and comfortable. Don\\'t let the idea of a futon deter you from staying! It was extremely comfortable and cozy. The shower had great water pressure. I had everything I needed and more. It was only a $9 Uber ride to the music venue I visited, Exit/In. There is a beautiful walking path almost directly behind the home. Michele and Collier were warm, welcoming, hospitable, and friendly. They even left me a thermos of coffee in the morning! Shout (dog) and Serendipity (cat) were well behaved and adorable! I hope to stay here again on my next visit to Nashville!  Our visit to Nashville was a special experience. From the first day when we arrived at Michele\\'s \\'Nashville Charm\\' to the last day, we enjoyed every minute. Michele is a wonderful person and so is her husband and daughter whom we also got to meet. We were treated like family, our hearts opened up and it was hard to leave these charming people. We got a list of things to do in and around Nashville and we tried our best to \\'work\\' this list. Every tip was special and we had a great time. The room we stayed in was very spacious, so we could spread out our \\'shopping bounty\\' each evening. The park behind the house was great to do our jogging in the morning. A smart family dog accompanied us. We highly recommend this beautiful place in Nashville East. We will be back, for sure.  Michelle was very quick to respond to any messages that were sent.  Although I didn\\'t get to meet her, I was able to meet her daughter.  She was very nice and gave me a tour of the house.  The house was easy to find.  The set up of the house was nice.  I had my own bathroom that was for guest use only.  The beds were very comfy.  There was wifi offered as well as a box fan in the closet.  I was able to set the temperature of the room to anything I wanted.  The dogs and cat were sweet.   My pal and I were only in town for a couple of days, but we could have stayed forever at this incredibly beautiful and comfortable home. We were warmly welcomed and had a lovely time. Everything was just perfect. we\\'re hoping to visit again. Thank you! :) We had a lovely stay in a lovely home--Michele was away, but Collier and Keezee were both very kind and welcoming. Two very cute dogs and an affectionate cat were bonuses. Thank you for having us. We hope to stay again. Wonderful hosts!! Very accommodating and helpful. We had everything we needed. We will most definitely be staying with Michele and family again! We enjoyed our stay in their beautiful home. Thank you again :) We stayed 5 nights in this inviting 1930\\'s bungalow sited in a lovely historical neighborhood in hip East Nashville.  We came to explore and enjoy the music, culture and food.  Collier, Keezee and Michelle were knowledgeable, interesting and warm hosts.  I am a coffee fanatic and it was so nice to have a hot thermos prepared by Collier and waiting each morning before starting on new adventures.  Our private room was large and comfortable with a private bath adjacent.   The location is quite walkable to good restaurants, shops and The Family Wash for music.  There is a great park right out the back door for running or biking.  Lyft was an easy option for more distant clubs and restaurants in other neighborhoods.  We would definitely return. My mom and I stayed with Michele during CMA Fest 2015 and my mom returned for CMA Fest 2016. Michele is a fantastic host. Her house is in a great area and is so welcoming. I would highly recommend staying with Michele when you visit Nashville :)  We had an excellent stay at this Airbnb in Nashville. Located in a great neighbourhood not to far from downtown, the room was just as described and parking available in front of house. Michele was out of town during our visit but Collier her husband did a great job at making us welcome. I highly recommend this accomodation and will stay here again on my next visit to Nashville. I had a wonderful time during my brief stay in Nashville. Collier was an excellent host, and was very kind and accommodating. The location was excellent- I brought my bike and was able to ride from the house to downtown, mostly on a protected bike lane!  Our stay was great, the house was absolutely charming and our host was very friendly. The room (s) were very spacious and clean. I\\'d definitely consider staying in the same place if I go back to Nashville.  Our stay at Michele\\'s was a very enjoyable experience.We didn\\'t get to meet Michele but Collier was a real gentleman and did all he could to make us feel at home.If he left for work before we got up he always left out fresh coffee and cups ready to go.Interaction with the family and pets is part of the experience at this BNB and it suited me completely.If I returned to Nashville this is the first place I would look for. The listing at Michele\\'s place was exactly as described and more. I give this host 5stars! We had a wonderful time staying over Nashville Charm. We will definitely be staying here again in our next Nashville visit. We were made to feel very comfortable as soon as we got in we got a tour of the beautiful home. Our bedroom was very spacious, clean and cozy. The bathroom was clean with a cool shower head, plenty of water. The kitchen had everything you will need, and clean. The house pets were friendly. Michele and her husband were great hosts. We highly recommend this listing!!  The host canceled this reservation 169 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. We arrived after a very long car ride to find a cool and very comfortable bedroom waiting for us. Collier and Michelle had everything waiting perfectly. When we met Michelle, she greeted us with a hug. Very warm hearts, indeed! A true airbnb experiance. Michele and Collier are remarkeble persons which made our three days stay with them an event we will never forget. They were helpful in many ways and it was obvious that they enjoy hosting. We felt truly at home.   Michelle and Collier were amazing host.  very open and friendly.  My wife hasn\\'t stopped telling her friends about the lovely accomodations.  less than a mile from. great eats and local bars...Amazing!! We had a great stay here, the house is beautiful and comfortable and in a lovely neighbourhood. There are bars, restaurants and shops in walking distance and easy public transport access to downtown. Unfortunately we didn\\'t get to meet Michelle but were hosted wonderfully by her husband Collier who gave us some great tips on places to visit both in the local area and downtown, and was good company during our stay. We would definitely recommend staying here if you are visiting Nashville.  We\\'ve been traveling for a bit now and this was definitely our favorite place to stay! We had everything we needed and the location is great! Most importantly, Collier (Michele husband) was the best host! He was super nice and helpful & greeted us with fresh coffee every morning! Definitely a place we\\'d come back to! The house was very clean and the rooms as well. The hosts were very helpful, kind and welcoming. Would definitely recommend a stay here! Lovely home that certainly has the Nashville charm! The host was lovely, so friendly and gave us lots of useful information. \\nIn a great area of Nashville. Cheap $5 uber to funky area of east Nashville - 5 Points with bars and restaurants and also right next to a park.  Downtown Nashville is only a short 15min drive away.\\nWould recommend to anyone wanting to stay in the area.  This is the most amazing place to stay. Beautiful space, lovely hosts, wonderful location... Walkable neighborhood near a park which I\\'m sure we would have explored more, except it was August and just too hot! Did walk to dinner one evening and were able to get everywhere we wanted in Nashville quickly and easily. \\r\\n\\r\\nSuch a great experience - I\\'m trying to find another reason to go to Nashville so I can stay here again! The host canceled this reservation 40 days before arrival. This is an automated posting. This was by far the best value Air Bnb we\\'ve ever stayed in. Beautiful big room, clean lovely bathroom with endless hot water and fantastic wifi. We didn\\'t meet Michelle but met Collier who gave us great tips about what to do (tomato festival) and where to eat (far east nashville) and was generally a very kind and friendly host. East Nashville is a cool neighbourhood with a short Lyft to Broadway if you want.  An extra bonus were the house\\'s adorable pets who we enjoyed playing with. Thanks so much Collier and Michelle! We were made to feel very welcome did not meet Michelle as she had family business to take care of but her husband Collier was great he could not do enough for us. The house is very old but homley.& street parking is fine .Very close to town & a bus stop nearly at the door for bus into downtown they run about every 25 mins better than trying to park downtown.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Unfortunately we did not get to meet Michele but Collier (Michele\\'s husband) took great care of us. The house had a great feel and the room was very spacious. All of the household facilities were offered to us which was convenient. It was only a 15 minute bus ride to Downtown or a short walk to the great selection of local restaurants/cafes/ bars which were recommended in Michele\\'s Guidebook. Highly recommend! Michele couldn\\'t be there, but her husband was very welcoming. While we couldn\\'t stay in the room we booked because of family stuff, the room we stayed in was comfortable and clean. Things came up in Michele\\'s life so small things needed changing, but she was quick to inform us of changes and offer alternatives.  It was amazing to stay here. Collier was so kind and made me feel at home right away. I enjoyed his stories and felt like a member of The family. It was better then i hoped for. I would love to go back someday. The location is great. Nearby downtown and throug The backyard you walk right into a Nice park where i spotted deer and Beavers. It was The best place with The nicest people. I thank them so much for feeling safe and at home in The beautifull Nashville❤️ Michele was not there on our arrival, but her husband Collier gave us a great welcome, he shared personal stories with us, my wife and I really appreciated his company, my wife and I traveled by public transport, there was a bus stop just outside the property which was ideal, we met Michele & Collier\\'s son Ben, their daughter Kizzie and Ben\\'s girlfriend Kirsty who was also on hand to answer our questions, the house was full of character and we enjoyed meeting their 3 dog\\'s Scout, Lola and Charlie plus their cat Serendipity whom we could have adopted, we were fortunate to meet Michele on our final night, we would highly recommend this listing and we would definitely stay here if we visit Nashville again, many thanks to Michele & Collier for a fantastic stay, PS would like to thank Collier for taking us to Greyhound bus station for our connecting transfer to Memphis... Beautiful place and great hosts! We loved staying there! And Nashville is great!  Michele and her family were incredibly welcoming and made us feel so at home. Their house is beautiful and filled with art! We were happy to sit and chat with them and learn about their lives and the area, and also felt free to come and go as we pleased. Wished we could have stayed longer! I loved staying here! I was welcomed upon my arrival by the whole family, their 3 dogs and Serendipity (my favorite cat of all time who wags her tail like a puppy!) Michele & Collier\\'s daughter Kizzie, son Ben, and his girlfriend Kirsty were all so very nice and responsive, ensuring my stay there was as comfortable as possible. I really enjoyed my conversations with Collier and Michele.\\r\\nThe house is warm and full of character, located in a beautiful area. The room I stayed in was very comfortable and I slept well (which is not always the case for me). It was also a cheap uber ride to anywhere in Nashville I wanted to go.\\r\\nThis will be the first place I check availability for next time I travel to Nashville! \\r\\n\\r\\n Everything about our experience was brilliant! Michele was away so her family took care of us. Everyone was so nice to us and we felt very welcome. They also have some really cute pets. The house is homely,in a quiet neighbourhood in East Nashville but is close to downtown and the bars in East Nashville. We would recommend their place to anyone staying in Nashville. Thank you for having us!   I was impressed with the home and my acommodations.  I couldn\\'t have asked for more. This was my first Airbnb and Michele and her family were very welcoming and sweet.  Wonderful people and great house.  I would most definitely stay again if I return to Nashville. This was a great place to stay. From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel very welcome and Michelle\\'s daughter was especially good at meet and greet. The location was convenient for access to Nashville and to ìnteresting local restaurants as well as a local park for early morning strolls. Thank you Michelle and family- we hope the dog is Ok. Michele was very nice and welcoming. She made me feel at home. She checked to make sure I had what I needed and was comfortable. The house is very neat...I loved all the colors. Great neighborhood. I walked down the street to a little shopping area with restaurants.  We had a great stay: warm and welcoming family with friendly pets in a really nicely decorated house. The green room in the photos is no longer available. The tan room was a little noisy as it is next to the kitchen and main living area, but nothing that earplugs couldn\\'t solve. Note also that the full/double bed is a pullout sofa bed. Michele and her family were great hosts. Thank you so much! We hebben een erg leuke tijd gehad in Nashville bij Michele en haar familie. We hebben genoten van de gesprekken, de buurt en vooral de verande is heerlijk om te zitten. Great room near everything. Would recommend this for anyone who needs a nice place to stay for cheap in Nashville. Michele is a wonderful host! She\\'s relaxed, positive and part of a generous and very welcoming family. Everything was perfectly clean and we could make use of the kitchen at our convenience. Michele made us a flask of great coffee to start the day every morning and even shared some homemade blackberry pie with us. Delicious, thank you! The whole was hospitable, very welcoming and offered their local knowledge and recommendations without hesitation. It was home from home for us. Thank you so much!  Michele and Collier are wonderful hosts! They are warm, lovely people with an amazing and unique home. We felt very welcome, and enjoyed the family feel of the Airbnb. This was our first time staying in an Airbnb with the hosts present, and it was a great experience. Michele made us brownies and provided maps and information about Nashville and the local neighborhoods and welcomed us to use her kitchen, living space and front porch furniture. We also enjoyed playing with their friendly pets! \\nThank you Michele for a great first Nashville experience! This house is very close to the bus stop (No. 4). So, there is no problem to use public transportation. The special thing was the kindness of hosts. I felt the life of American family. You can have a dream with comfort. I strongly recommend this house. We had a great stay at Michelle and Collier.   They have a very charming older home in a very convenient neighborhood.   They were very welcoming and friendly.  They also have some sweet pets.   I think their cat may have been disappointed when we left.   Nice folks with a funky house in East Nashville. Great bargain accommodations with a futon and shared baths. Good location to access restaurants and downtown. Recommend.  We had a great stay at Michele\\'s! She made us feel at home straight away and all of her family were friendly and full of suggestions for things we could do in the area. The room is spacious and the futon is very comfortable. The house is in a pretty neighbourhood only a short drive from town, with regular bus service too. We would definitely stay here again!  Michelle and Collier were amazing hosts! When booking, Michele was extremely responsive and accommodating. Their home is charming, cozy and situated just a short drive from Broadway. They welcomed us into their home with open arms and told us to make use of the kitchen and living room as we pleased. They kept their entire house spotless, including the bathrooms. Michelle provided us with maps and bus schedules to help us navigate the city and Collier had fresh coffee waiting for us each morning. Very sweet, genuine family with some very loving pets as well! We will be visiting again. Overall was a great first Airbnb experience! My sister and I both absolutely loved staying here! The house was gorgeous and Michele and her husband were both very welcoming. Would definitely stay here again!!! Absolutely wonderful place to stay. The host is super friendly, and the location...well, you just can\\'t beat it. It was a very cool house, very welcoming, totally worth it and I\\'d love to stay again! Such a lovely home feel.  The hosts are warm and inviting.   Michele and Collier were such sweet hosts. I went out to pack and start my car at 7 in the morning and it was dead! So Collier woke up, dug out some jumper cables, and jumped off my car for me. Then he hugged me and said thanks for staying with us. I couldn\\'t have asked for nicer hosts. \\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, note that the house is very creaky at night when others are moving around, it made it a little hard for me to get to sleep.  Staying at Michele\\'s place was great. It\\'s in a hip and neighborhood and the house itself is very beautiful.  Michele and her family are very friendly and accommodating and helped make my first experience in Nashville a great one. The house from inside out is a charming oasis, and in a great location. There are many walking distance attractions, or you can drive few mins to downtown. Michele and the family were nothing but sweet and helpful to my stay. If you get a chance you should stay with them.  Michele and her husband were exceedingly friendly and went out of their way to ensure we had a comfortable stay. We would recommend their funky place and stay again.  Our stay with Michele and Collier was really, really great. Their home is so very wonderful and everything was exactly as described in the listing. Their suggestions for eats were spot on and would highly recommend staying here.   Michele and her family are so warm and welcoming! My boyfriend and I had an excellent trip and we would absolutely stay here again. Exceptionally cosy, beautiful place. Great location in East Nashville, and would happily stay here again! Such nice people! Michele and Collier were wonderful hosts! The home itself was spacious yet inviting, and their company was especially warm. While we only crossed paths in the mornings, and briefly in the evening, I always felt welcomed. The location was great, and easily accessible to all parts of town. I highly recommend a stay for anyone looking for accommodations with personality.  This was an excellent place to stay! Michele is a very friendly and loved person. She and her family make us feel comfortable all the time. The street is super quiet and easy to park. Nashville is a very nice city and easy to get around by car. It\\'s a good location even being a bit far from Music Row. Michele\\'s historic, cozy home is the perfect place for a quiet stay in Nashville.  An easy walk to the bustling restaurant and nightlife district, as well as a beautiful park.  I was charmed by the dogs and Serendipity, the very affectionate cat.  Great value in a charming neighbourhood.   We had an absolutely lovely stay and couldn\\'t have asked for a better host, location, and home away from home. Walking distance to great spots in East Nashville, porch swing to enjoy your cup of tea, sweet pets to cuddle and an incredible shower! We really couldn\\'t have asked for more. Thanks for having us!  We enjoyed a comfortable stay in Nashville -everything was as described. The room was large and light with a single bed and and a sofa. Cups and a selection of teas was left out for us in the mornings. The host was flexible with check-in when our flight was delayed late at night. The pets were friendly and unobstrusive, but remember to close the bedroom doors when you go out unless you want to find them sleeping on your bed when you get back!! Nice place, great location!  This is a nice area, and we enjoyed our stay. They were super accommodating when we needed to change our schedule and were extremely kind and helpful. Great suggestions of places to go and in a great location close enough to walk to shops or a restaurant but remote enough to be peaceful and enjoyable. They have a beautiful home and are a welcoming family.  Loved Michele\\'s house.

Staying in this home at least once is a must! Home away from home! We loved staying at the house of Michele and Collier. Our room was spacious, clean and comfy. The house ist so individual and unique. It is located in a quiet neighborhood but just 5 Minutes away from downtown by car. We could park just in front of the house. We will definitely come back!

Can\\'t wait to go back! We highly recommend this place. The house and room is so nice, the animals adorable and the neighborhood is very tranquil.

Direkt hinter dem Haus ein wunderschöner Park.  I had an excellent stay in Michele\\'s home and it was the perfect way to kick off my 3-month road trip. The home is in a very nice historic district east of downtown Nashville. Quiet, well-kept neighborhood and the house and room were exactly as described. Everything was clean and the bed was extremely comfortable. The two small dogs and cat were very friendly. The room I stayed in had 5 large windows overlooking the back yard and the entrance to a very nice city park. I wish I had known about this place when I visited Nashville last year!  Easy to get downtown or to the football stadium.  I highly recommend Michele as an Airbnb host! Michele\\'s place was incredible! Everything was clean and cozy and extremely thoughtful. The room is very spacious with a little nook that had all the amenities of the nicest bed and breakfasts we\\'ve stayed at (coffee, tea, fridge, etc). Her dogs Scout and Lola are so friendly and adorable. The house is also located near many cool restaurants and coffee shops in East Nashville and she gave us fantastic recommendations. I couldn\\'t recommend Michele\\'s place more and we would love to stay with her again next time we come through town Lovely hosts and wonderful house. Close to nashville Michelle is a fantastic host \"au petits soins de ses invités\" as WE said in France I can\\'t say enough good things about Michele\\'s place! The hosts are charming and very accommodating. Great location if you want to be in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood that\\'s less than 10 min from downtown. Huge, gorgeous house with everything you need.... felt like I was staying with an old friend. Michelle\\'s home was fantastic. She was the sweetest host. She and her husband offered great advice and were very hospitable. Her house is perfect if you are exploring Nashville. It is a 10-20 minute ride from anything you will want to do. $7 for our ride to downtown Nashville. I highly recommend staying here. The dogs are the sweetest ever!  Beautiful home and lovely family! Wonderful location near delicious restaurants and scenic park along the river. I can\\'t wait to stay here again!  Michele\\'s house was very cute and clean!

A fridge, coffee tea and the friendliest furry friends. Michelle and family gave us food and site seeing recommendations.  I was there for a retreat and spent most of the time on the retreat site but was very pleased to come home to a quiet welcoming home. Da Michele während unseres Aufenthaltes nicht da war, wurden wir wie vorab informiert von ihrer Tochter in empfang genommen. Sie begrüsste uns sehr härzlich, stellte uns die Tiere vor (Hunde und Katze), zeigte uns das Schlaf- und Badezimmer. Sie war sehr offen und informativ gewesen. Bei Fragen hätten wir sie jederzeit fragen können. Es war alles sehr sauber und schön eingerichtet. Wir schätzten den grossen Kühlschrank sehr. Mit dem Auto erreichten wir Nashville innert 5 Minuten. Dies war sehr praktisch. Das Haus war sehr euhig gelegen und wir konnten gut schlafen und entspannen. Es war ein sehr schöner und unkomplizierter Aufenthalt. Während unserem Trip war dies die beste Unterkunft. Wir empfehlen sie auf jedenfall weiter. Vielen Dank nochmals Sandra und Rama Beautiful, hip home with the cutest pets! Great location, just minutes from downtown. Very comfortable and spacious room. Enjoyed my stay! Great location and great price! Very friendly, would highly recommend.

Park right behind her house and bus stop on her corner street..just minutes from downtown!!! She is always first on our list when we head to nashville Michele and her husband were wonderful hosts! The space and house was very welcoming and comfortable. Her husband recomended many places to go eat/shop with in walking distance from the house. The neighborhood is close to many things but still secluded enough for a good amount of peace and quiet. Over all my Fiancé and I had a very enjoyable stay. Would definitely book again! Great location, very close to city! Hosts were very welcoming and hospitable. No problems whatsoever! Perfect stopover in this superb house, where I was welcomed by the companion of Michèle who is simply a great person. If you are going to Nashville this is the place to be We absolutely adored our stay! Right in the heart of gorgeous East Nashville, but close enough to get downtown easily. Michele and Collier\\'s house is an absolute dream, and we particularly loved their sweet cat Serendipity. It\\'s a very small, quaint place just minutes from downtown Nashville.  It was easy to find and very close to some great walking paths.  It\\'s a very basic place though, not for the high-maintenance.  We\\'d definitely stay again for the value and proximity to the city and airport.  Thanks for having us! We stayed in upstairs in this colorful and charming house the night before the Great American Solar Eclipse and Michele was very thoughtful to provide us with glasses! We were greeted by her husband Collier and their cute little dog Scout and immediately felt so welcomed into their home like we were family. The upstairs bedroom and bathroom were very comfortable and we were delighted to have coffee, tea, a fridge and a toaster available right in the room. We stayed here as part of a Tennessee roadtrip for the eclipse, and if our itinerary had allowed we would have definitely stayed longer to explore all of Michele and Collier\\'s great East Nashville suggestions. They\\'re wonderful hosts and this is a great, well-located place to stay. Cozy and spacious room, very homey.  We slept really well. I would have given more stars if there were more to give. My room was quite large and comfortable in a beautiful house--the kind where everywhere you look there\\'s something to see. My host was helpful, friendly, conversational, intelligent, and kind. When I come back to Nashville this is where I want to stay. Michele\\'s place was a great spot to stay. It is just 10 min from downtown Nashville and Michele and her husband are very accommodating. Their dog is small and nice.  He barks a little when he first sees you but we didn\\'t hear him at all the rest of the time/night. Their house is vibrant with color and feels very welcoming.

Tons of natural light, park views, convenient location (less than 15 min from our destinations), super-accommodating hosts, friendly pets, and a great value. I\\'d definitely stay here again! This place and the owners are the BOMB! I loved everything! As a person from fareast asia, seeing the cultural touches in every aspect of the house made me feel so at home. I actually wouldn’t mind staying the whole day indoors cos it was just so pretty :) The owners and pets were the sweetest too! I wish I could’ve stayed longer.  I didn’t actually meet Michele, but her daughter was there to greet me and she did so well helping me get acclimated! I had driven from Ohio, on my way across country from the east coast and I was in poor spirits from the drive. Her daughter knew i wasn’t feeling well, and scrounged up some of their honey to give me for my tea. :) The animals were a bonus, and the reviews do not lie! What are you waiting for—book this place!!!  We had a wonderful experience at Michele’s house. The space was spotless and very welcoming. The bed in the green room is the most comfortable bed I’ve ever slept on! I will definitely stay here again next time I’m in Nashville. Great place! Would definitely book here again. Great space and stylish. Michele is undoubtedly one of the best hosts I have had. She was very warm and welcoming from the beginning to the end. The communication was great and she was very quick with her responses.\\nFor her space, I’d say it’s fabulous and I strongly recommend it to everyone visiting Nashville. The space has 2 rooms and a private bath and everything was sparkling clean and she already had coffee and tea ready for us when we arrived. \\nOverall a fantastic experience. Thank you, Michele. The house is very well decorated and clean. The location is great.  Michele was SO nice!  I wish I had longer to stay just to get to know her and Collier better.  :)\\n\\nAs for the space, hip, well apportioned, lots of room (in fact, an extra room), and Nashville’s best pour over coffee!!!  This was one of my favorite stays yet at and Airbnb!  Oh, and one last thing: the value was unbeatable! This was an excellent place to stay! Very cute and charming house, with excellent hospitality.  Absolutely charming place and charming hosts. The space was very private and we had everything we needed. Michele and Collier (and the dogs!) gave us a great welcome with early check-in and lots of suggestions on what to do/see.  Gracious Hospitality in a peaceful space. Michele was a terrific host! She met me and my sister the day we arrived.  Our flight landed at 9AM and she was so gratious to allow us to leave our luggage at her house until check in  at 3PM.   The room was immaculate with plenty of space for the two of us.  It was everything we needed down in Nashville.  The location was great.  We were only about a 7 min drive from Broadway, extremely easy to get an uber or lyft, to and from our location.  We will definitely be staying here the next time we are in Nashville! Such a cute place. We didn’t spend much time there but we’re super impressed with the Nashville charm. Thanks Michele ! Michele is a great host. She is kind and helpful with a couple of good recommendations for the area. The room/house is lovely - spacious with lots of  extras. Great stay and value. Would definitely come back.  Great location, easy check in/out and friendly hosts! Super cool purple house in a great location. It’s a quick walk to 5 points. The room is very comfortable and the hosts are sweet and responsive. Loved meeting the dogs and the cat!!! Highly recommend staying here! Thanks!  My husband and I had a great stay here. It was a lovely home with a comfortable guest space - which feels very private even though it is not separated from the main house. Unfortunately, we didn\\'t get to meet Michele on the trip, but her partner was very welcoming and had lots of great tips for places to enjoy in the neighborhood. I did not get to meet Michele but her husband Collier was an amazing host to my cousin and I as we were traveling through Nashville. He gave us a lot of great tips on navigating the city and I wish we were able to stay there longer and chat! I would definitely recommend staying here - the home is in a great, safe location about 10 minutes from the city. I would certainly stay here again next time I’m in Nashville. Dogs and cat were an added bonus!  I did not get the chance to meet Michele personally, but we communicated a few times very pleasantly. Her family are the kindest people! And their animals have so much personality and spunk, which I enjoyed. The space was large, comfortable, and the view from the room was beautiful. It was very clean. The house felt very safe. If you are into interior decorating, you’ll be amazed with how Michele arranged and furnished the house! I loved my stay and would recommend.  We enjoyed a wonderful stay at Nashville Charm.

Probably my favourite Airbnb, what a beautiful house in an awesome city. We wished we could stay longer, Collier (the host) was incredible warm, thoughtful & accommodating. Nothing was too much trouble & he was so interesting to talk to. It felt like home away from home but definitely with some Nashville charm. The doggies were so lovely & the adorable cat too just made our time even better. We had some of the best sleep we’ve had on our American travels & are very well rested, we hope to come back one day in the future. We loved the tea bags, the kettle, the fridge & the water available too. An extra bonus! Thank you so much!  This was a wonderful spot. We had so much fun and their animals were so sweet!

Michele and Collier open their home with an ample welcome and everything an overnight guest could want. Our one night was too short, so plan to stay a bit to enjoy both urban culture and nearby nature. Their location is perfectly situated for dining, entertainment, walking, cycling, and sleeping late! Michele’s Airbnb was everything we expected and more, very clean, cozy, and convenient location. She was a great host, staying in contact with us and making sure we had everything we needed. I would recommend this Airbnb to anyone looking to experience Nashville in somewhere that feels as comfortable as your own home. This place is WONDERFUL!

This is definitely the best place to stay in Nashville! Michele’s place was a fabulous place to stay. Her home is so unique and the room she offers is spacious and comfortable. \\nHer and her husband made every effort to make sure me and mine had everything we needed. \\nIf we come back to Nashville we will definitely stay there again! Michele was a great host right near the heart of Nashville. I had great parking in a neighborhood and it was quiet and good to have her space to rest.

I wish I had had more time to enjoy it and explore the vast bookshelves! The bed was comfortable, the space was clean, and I felt right at home!

The host was super helpful and helped with restaurant suggestions and directions. We loved getting to know each other and getting to pet their sweet animals.  We can’t wait to book this house again next time we’re in town! The space was truly charming. We really appreciated the house with it\\'s artsy decor, the room with its wall of windows, the way everything was set up and the neighborhood. The only drawback: the aggressively friendly cat who scratched my husband\\'s foot as he tried to close the door to our room. Then he scratched him again the next day - drawing blood each time. We like cats, but this one would not stay back. I had to carry a pillow to keep him from rubbing against me when walking from bedroom to bathroom. I just didn\\'t want the hair on my pant legs. The dogs like the bedroom too, but they were kept safely away. Michele and her family are lovely. You have your own section of the house, lots of space and everything you need. Great location, easy to catch the bus or a Lyft around Nashville. We loved the pets too! Would definitely recommend staying here. Une bonne adresse dans un quartier calme et chic de Paducah.

Loved my time here. we thoroughly enjoyed our stay with michele and collier. they were truely so lovely and welcoming, everything was amazing.its a great location and the house is super cool. ask about the tapestries while youre there - they have a very cool story. \\n\\n as a side note -  me and my husband are both allergic to cats so came armed with allergy meds but the cat didnt bother us at all, so dont let it deter you from staying here.

The host Michele and her husband are so kind and showed us amazing hospitality! The house is beautiful and in a great location. Definitely would book again. Michele\\'s place is our go-to in Nashville. We have stayed in multiple places throughout Nashville during my husband\\'s schooling and no place could beat Michele\\'s on price, location, comfort, and hosts. We are so grateful we were able to stay with Michele and Collier numerous times the past few months. Very warm and wonderful hosts! Great location, great home. We loved the accommodations. Appreciated the coffee service in the room. We would absolutely recommend this location and stay here again! Very comfortable! I felt like I was staying with a family member.  Michele greeted me with a hug and was very friendly and accommodating. Her home is conveniently located in close proximity to downtown and it was very easy to take an uber to Broadway. Highly recommend! Michele and Collier are great hosts and very friendly. We rented a car and drove around. The buss system is tricky . If you drive we found parking for $10 at the Quiznos downtown. Way cheap. \\nBring a facemask if you want it dark since the sun will wake you up.  We bought our breakfast and ate there. 5points has some good local restaurant and 20 Min walking distance.  We had a great bday celebration and would stay at their home again. As expected You can not beat this place. Michelle is a lovely host, her home is beautiful and it is located in a wonderful neighborhood. The space I was in was comfortable, clean, and overwhelmingly comfortable. You can not beat it. Great space and exactly what we needed! The house itself is very cool and our space was more private than I expected given its shared accommodation. Very unique. Very well located if you love East Nashville with lots of transportation options if you prefer to go downtown  and don’t want to drive. The hosts were gracious and also respected our privacy. Would 100% stay again if we returned to Nashville. Michele and her husband are the best hosts we ever had! They are incredibly friendly and helpful. We wish we could have stayed longer - they made us feel home far away from home! Thank you! My stay was wonderful. Michele and her partner are very kind and hospitable. The accommodations were clean and cozy. Their dog, Scout, added a fun bonus to the visit. Highly recommend! Michelle’s house is comfortable & has everything you need included maps. the room was large & spacious. $10 Uber ride to downtown & was a safe area. We had a great visit, I would highly recommend! One of the best AirBnBs I’ve ever been to. I was welcomed warmly, the space was huge, and had so many amenities. When we come back there is no other place we will go. Thank you! Michele\\'s upstairs suite was very cute and cozy, with plenty of space for two people. We appreciated the fresh local coffee and tea provided as well. Very friendly and kind hosts who have a beautiful and artsy Victorian home. Nashville charm is an understatement. Michele’s place is so beautiful and lively but furthermore really makes you feel at home and welcome. She is so friendly and accommodating. We were so sad to leave. Highly recommend booking this for your stay! I absolutely loved the open hospitality and the beautiful space! The neighborhood is great and I wish I could have stayed longer. Great! Comfortable and cozy. Very nice people. I had an amazing experience in Nashville and this place contributed to that. The house is cozy and clean and the landlord is very nice and made me comfortable right away. I seriously recommend this place not only for the house itself but also for the host. Great place Michele and Collier are excellent hosts. Southern hospitality at its finest! Super colorful home, both literally and figuratively. The room and amenities are great—we used the mini fridge and pour-over coffee extensively—and the location for those who\\'ve never been to East Nashville is fantastic. Easy Lyft/Uber to downtown, quick walk to the near restaurants and shops of Five Points, and the greenbelt of Shelby Bottoms for those like me who want to go for a jog in the morning. Top notch! If we\\'re back in Nashville, we\\'ll be staying here again if it\\'s available. Thanks, Collier and Michele! Great place to stay and wonderful hosts. Not far from downtown Nashville and a park nearby. We highly recommend this place to anyone. Especially to those who appreciate being in an eclectic and fun home with personal engagement by the host, in a quiet leafy neighbourhood. We enjoyed our stay very much! Great location for easy access to downtown Nashville. These folks really are superhosts. An excellent accommodation and a really good base to discover Nashville. Nearby good options for breakfast and dinner, an quiet neighborhood... I would definitely would love to come back one day.\\n\\nThank you very much Michele and Collier! You made my stay in Nashville even more special! Michele and Collier were amazing hosts! Their home is absolutely beautiful, in the perfect location, and we truly felt at home! We would stay here forever if we could! A great place to stay in East Nashville, just a short ways from 5 Points and an easy drive to downtown. The house is adorable, the room was spacious and comfortable, and they had such great tips for my first time in Nashville! Would definitely stay here again A great spot close to downtown. Would definitely recommend! Great place to stay Great place in a lovely neighborhood. The room is super big and comfy. Would definitely stay again. Nice quiet private room and bathroom.  Perfect location to access the city and super accessible park in walking distance. If you\\'re visiting Nashville and need a place to stay, check if Michele\\'s place is available. Our hosts were warm and welcoming without being overbearing. The apartment was superb and comfortable, and we found it easy to navigate all the hot spots from the house. I truly hope that I\\'ll be able to return for another visit in future. Great location in East Nashville. We stayed for one night only and wished we had planned a longer stay. Nice, friendly couple. Close to downtown. Was given some guidance to places to eat and parking downtown. Place was comfortable, clean , and quiet.  Would stay there again! Michele\\'s place is perfect for a stay in Nashville - near to everything in the heart of the city. \\n\\nThe space is wonderfully quirky and comfortable - and I especially enjoyed browsing the books on the shelves.\\n\\nThere\\'s also a walkway to the river from their backyard.\\n\\nThey are truly superhosts and it\\'s a gem of a place. If you get a chance to stay here, I HIGHLY recommend it! If you are looking for a great place to stay during your visit to Nashville, this is the place for you. Michele and her husband are very accommodating hosts. The room in their home is very cozy and the beds are extremely comfortable. They have a rainfall shower head in the guest bathroom and amazing water pressure for those of you who are like me and value those things. Great stay and great locations, perfect for a quick overnight with my family. Great place to stay'"
